1,AI - Amnesty International,"   Amnesty International Submission for the Universal Periodic Review of the United Kingdom       21 November 2011  United Kingdom Amnesty International submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review 13th session of the UPR Working Group, May-June 2012   Follow up to the previous review At the time of its first UPR in April 2008, the UK accepted a number of recommendations made by other States including on issues related to counter-terrorism,1 violence against women2 and human rights obligations in armed conflict.3   Some positive steps have been taken by the government with respect to these recommendations, for example as regards violence against women. An action plan has been developed entitled Action Plan: Call to End Violence Against Women and Girlsno recourse to  to immigration control who had experienced violence in the UK, to access income and housing support.4 From April 2012, a change in policy will mean that women who apply for leave to remain in the UK using the Domestic Violence Rule will be allowed to access benefits necessary to fund emergency accommodation.5 However, regrettably there has been no progress on setting up an observatory or strategic oversight body, independent of the government, to ensure more effective protection of women and girls from violence. There is also widespread concern about the failure of central government to ensure that all women and girls who experience violence have access to specialised support in the community to help them escape abuse and rebuild their lives. With respect to recommendations made in the context of counter-terrorism and human rights, a move in the right direction has been the reduction in the number of days an individual suspected of terrorism-related offences can be detained before charge. However, several counter-terrorism policies continue to give rise to concern, including plans to further expand the deportation with assurances programme (see below).    rights concerns in the UK, or result in adequate recommendations.  Many of the human rights concerns raised by Amnesty International at the time remain and are therefore included in this submission with recommendations for action by the government to address them.        Amnesty International Submission for the Universal Periodic Review of the United Kingdom     21 November 2011   2 Normative and institutional framework of the State Domestic legal framework Amnesty International is concerned about statements by UK government ministers about their an Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in domestic law.6 A Commission has obligations under the Convention. However, the Commission operates within a political environment that is openly hostile to human rights, and Amnesty International fears that the process may lead to a reduction in their promotion and protection by weakening the framework for enforcing those rights.  There has also been no significant progress in creating a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland tailored to its particular circumstances and history. Amnesty International considers that this must be separate from the broader discussion of a Bill of Rights for the UK.   While the Human Rights Act protects civil and political rights, the UK has not taken adequate measures to ensure that victims are able to access appropriate means of redress for violations of rights protected by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.   Extraterritorial applicability of human rights protection  The UK continues to take a narrow view of the extraterritorial application of international and regional human rights treaties, thereby undermining human rights protection and obstructing efforts by victims to obtain remedies and reparation for human rights violations.  For example, with respect to military operations overseas, the UK has emphasized that although its armed forces are required to comply with the absolute prohibition against torture as set out in the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, it has denied that the broader obligations and protections under the Convention, such as those in Article 2 to prevent acts of torture, apply extraterritorially.7 Similarly, the UK has attempted to limit the extent to which the European Convention on Human Rights applies to the actions of its armed forces abroad, arguing strenuously in two cases heard by the European Court of Human Rights  namely Al-Skeini and Al-Jedda - that protections of the Convention should not apply to UK forces in Iraq. These arguments were rejected by the Court, which in both cases found that the individuals concerned were within the UK8   A restrictive interpretation of the extraterritorial application of human rights protections under ns to regulate UK-based companies operating overseas. For example, a Business and Human Rights Toolkit published companies comply with UK human rights standar9 It appears that the UK neither recognises nor intends to observe its duties to ensure UK companies and members of UK-based corporate groups respect human rights when operating abroad.

The renamed regime allows administratively-ordered restrictions  which are slightly narrower than, but similar to, the restrictions under the previous regime - to be placed on individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activity.14 As with control order restrictions, TPIMs can amount to deprivation of liberty or constitute restrictions on the rights to privacy, expression, association and movement.15 The procedure for challenging the imposition of these measures still allows the government to rely on secret material which is not disclosed to the individual concerned or their lawyer of choice. The government has also prepared draft legislation, TPIMs.16 If enacted, such enhanced measures would allow the imposition of the most severe restrictions previously available under the control orders regime.  Deportations with assurances: The government has reaffirmed its intention to extend its deportations with assurances programme in order to facilitate the return of individuals, alleged to pose a threat to national security, to states where they face a real risk of torture and other ill-treatment.17 Amnesty International considers that such unenforceable promises of humane treatment, given by governments that torture, cannot reliably, effectively and sufficiently eliminate real risks of torture and ill-treatment of the individual upon return. Consequently, any expansion of ns.18 The UK government has posited that the provision of post-return monitoring will ensure safety on return. However, no system of post-return monitoring of individuals will render assurances an acceptable alternative to rigorous respect for the absolute prohibition of transfers of individuals to states where they are at real risk of torture or other ill-treatment.    Pre-charge detention: The number of days that an individual suspected of terrorism-related offences can be held in pre-charge detention was recently reduced from 28 to 14 days.19 Whilst this represents a step in the right direction, Amnesty International considers that the current 14 day limit is itself too long a period to detain individuals suspected of criminal offences without charge. The government has also published draft legislation which would allow the maximum period of pre- Failures of accountability In the context of the 2008 UPR, Amnesty International raised concern over failures of accountability by the UK.20 Regrettably, serious problems remain in this area, particularly in respect to allegations of UK complicity in torture and other human rights violations of individuals detained abroad in the context of counter-terrorism operations.21 In July 2010 the government announced the establishment of the Detainee Inquiry to look into these allegations. However, the Protocol of the    Amnesty International Submission for the Universal Periodic Review of the United Kingdom     21 November 2011   4 Detainee Inquiry falls short of human rights standards regarding the requirement to carry out effective, independent, impartial and thorough investigations into alleged human rights violations. Amnesty International is particularly concerned that the government retains the final say regarding the disclosure of information by the Detainee Inquiry. Such control undermines the independence of the Detainee Inquiry, as well as its effectiveness in offering some aspect of redress to alleged victims.22  Justice and Security Green Paper: In October 2011, the government put forward a number of proposals in a Green Paper on Justice and Security, which give rise to concern.23 Firstly, it proposes to expand the use of closed material procedures in civil proceedings, including in civil claims for damages where the state is accused of human rights violations. These procedures essentially allow the relevant court or tribunal to consider secret material presented by UK authorities in closed hearings. Such material is withheld from the other party, their lawyer of choice, and the public, none of whom has access to the closed hearing. Instead a Special Advocate is appointed to represent the interests of the excluded party in the closed part of the hearing. Amnesty International considers that the proposed measures would threaten fair trial rights in the UK and could result in victims of human rights violations being deprived of effective access to a judicial remedy. Amnesty International is also concerned that, if implemented, some of the proposals would allow the government to avoid scrutiny and criticism of its human rights record by severely limiting the ability of victims of human rights violations to seek disclosure of material pertaining to those violations in domestic courts on national security grounds.24  Protection of asylum-seekers and migrants Amnesty International is concerned by reports of dangerous and unsuitable control and restraint techniques used by private security companies contracted by the authorities during enforced removals from the UK.25 In at least one case, these techniques appear to have resulted in the death of an individual.26 Credible evidence indicates serious failings in the training of private contractors enforcing removals.27  Amnesty International is also concerned that in many cases detention solely for immigration purposes does not comply with relevant international refugee and human rights law and standards.   A proposal to abolish the migrant domestic workers visa enabling holders to change employers and still continue to work lawfully in the UK. The visa was originally introduced to address concern that many migrant domestic workers - the majority of whom are women  were becoming trapped in exploitative and abusive working relationships because their continued lawful stay in the UK was contingent on their continued employment by that employer.28 In light of this, the abolition of visa is likely to lead to an increase in the numbers of foreign workers subjected to exploitation and/or abuse.  Finally, Amnesty International is concerned that proposed cuts to publicly-funded legal representation (legal aid) will exacerbate the lack of legal aid for asylum and immigration legal advice, which is already limited or absent in some parts of the country. Recommendations for action by the State under review    Amnesty International Submission for the Universal Periodic Review of the United Kingdom     21 November 2011   5 Amnesty International calls on the government of the United Kingdom:   Follow-up to recommendations made in the 2008 UPR:  To ensure the full and effective implementation of the Action Plan: Call to End Violence Against Women and Girls, including by guaranteeing appropriate resources and funding for its effective implementation;   To establish an independent observatory or strategic oversight body, including relevant experts, to ensure more effective protection against violence for women and girls;  To ensure that all women and girls who experience violence have access to specialized community support.  National human rights protection mechanisms:  To reaffirm its commitment to the protection of all human rights in the UK and ensure that standards for their protection and means of enforcement under national law are the subject of progressive development, not regression;  To ensure the legal protection of all economic, social and cultural rights, including access to appropriate means of redress for the violation of these rights;  To establish a specific Bill of Rights or other human rights legislation for Northern Ireland which builds upon the rights enshrined in the Human Rights Act and takes into account the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.  Extraterritorial application of human rights treaties:  To fully recognize the extraterritorial application of human rights obligations under international and regional law and standards;   To fully respect the implications of the decision of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights in Al-Skeini Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, both in relation to the specific issues addressed in that judgment and with respect to the broader applicability of the territory;  To recognize the extraterritorial application of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, in line with the jurisprudence of the UN Committee Against Torture;  To take appropriate legislative and administrative measures to ensure that transnational corporations registered in the UK are required to exercise due diligence to avoid causing or contributing to human rights abuses in other countries, including as recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and to hold them accountable if they are found to have committed or contributed to human rights abuses in other countries, and to ensure access to remedy for the victims.  Human rights protection and counter-terrorism measures:    Amnesty International Submission for the Universal Periodic Review of the United Kingdom     21 November 2011   6  To ensure that counter-terrorism legislation and policy fully comply with international human rights law and standards and undergo adequate and timely public consultation;  To commit to investigate individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities and, where sufficient evidence exists, to prosecute them in the ordinary criminal courts, in conformity with international fair trial standards, rather than establish and use procedures such as control orders and Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures that circumvent and undermine the ordinary criminal justice process;  To further reduce the length of time that people suspected of terrorism-related activity can be detained prior to charge;  To abandon the policy of relying on diplomatic assurances against torture and other ill-treatment as a means of circumventing the prohibition on exposing individuals to the risk of such human rights violations through any form of involuntary transfer to the territory or custody of another state.  Failures of accountability:  To ensure that allegations of UK involvement in human rights violations are investigated in a manner that is effective, impartial, independent and thorough, in line with international human rights standards;   To make immediate changes to the Protocol to the Detainee Inquiry to ensure that it is compliant with international human rights standards, including by establishing an independent mechanism to determine what material may legitimately be withheld from the public;29  To ensure individuals who claim to have been subjected to human rights violations can seek access to an effective remedy and reparation, and to reject those proposals in the Justice and Security Green Paper that would restrict disclosure of material pertaining to human rights violations.  Protection of migrants and asylum-seekers:  To ensure all allegations of harm on removal from the UK are subject to effective investigation by an impartial and independent body;   To ensure all removals from the UK are independently monitored by a competent independent body who should accompany, monitor and report on all stages of the removal process;   To take concrete measures to reduce the resort to detention of individuals solely for immigration purposes, in line with relevant international refugee and human rights law and standards;   To ensure that foreign workers are not trapped in exploitative and abusive working relationships in the UK.                                                     1 Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review on the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 23 May 2008 (A/HRC/8/25), paragraphs 56.6 (Cuba, Ghana, the Netherlands), 56.10 (Russian Federation) and 56.8 (Russian Federation). 2 A/HRC/8/25, paragraph 56.1 (India). 3 A/HRC/8/25, paragraph 56.12 (Egypt).

The Court found the UK had failed to ensure such investigations in five of the six cases, in violation of Article 2 (right to life) of the Convention. The Court rejected arguments by the y. The Court held that the fact the UK was an occupying force over the territory in question and therefore exercised public powers there meant the European Convention applied. Such a situation, the Court held, was one among a range of scenarios where the Convention applies outside the ordinary territory of European states. In the case of Al-Jedda the Court found that the detention of Hilal Al-Jedda for over three years by UK armed forces without charge or trial was in violation of the Article 5 (right to liberty and security) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Court of Human Rights determined that the UK was legally responsible for the internment, even though UK forces at the time of the arrest were acting as part of the Multi-National Forces in Iraq, and that nothing in the UN Security Council Resolution 1546 disentitled him to the protections of the ECHR. 9 Business and Human Rights Toolkit: How UK overseas missions can promote good conduct by October 2009, page 4, states that: bligation but depends on the wording of the treaty obligation in question.

See also the Home Secre-Terrorism and Security Powers, on 26 January 2011, available at: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110126/debtext/110126-0001.htm#11012654000005 (accessed 21 November 2011). 18 Amnesty International also considers that appeal proceedings against orders for deportat on material kept secret from the individual and their legal counsel, not only in relatioto national security, but also with respect to the issue of whether they would face a risk or torture or other ill-treatment on return. 19 This step by the UK to reduce the number of days of pre-charge detention of individuals suspected of terrorism-related offences should also be viewed as a step towards implementing recommendations made by a number of States in the previous UPR with respect to pre-charge detention. See A/HRC/8/25, paragraphs 56.7-56.10 (Algeria, Russian Federation and Switzerland). 20 During the previous review Amnesty International raised a number of cases where there had been a failure on the part of the UK government to effectively, independently, impartially and thoroughly investigate serious allegations of human rights violations, including with respect to allegations of UK involvement in the US-led programmes of secret detentions and renditions. See United Kingdom: Submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review: First Session of HRC UPR Working Group 7-18 April 2008 (Index: EUR 45/020/2007) 21 November 2007. It should be noted that although this issue was not dealt with in great detail during the previous de information about so-secret flights, A/HRC/8/25, paragraph 56.10 (Russian Federation).  21 Evidence of UK involvement in human rights violations committed in the name of countering-terrorism has continued to mount since the previous UPR, most recently with respect to the discovery of documents indicating that the UK was involved in the unlawful transfer of two individuals to Libya, despite the real risk of torture and other ill-treatment those individuals would face upon return. The documents were discovered in Tripoli, Libya, by Human Rights Watch and concern the cases of Sami Mustafa al-Saadi and Abdel Hakim Belhaj, for further detail see: http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/09/08/usuk-documents-reveal-libya-rendition-details (accessed 21 November 2011).  22 Other concerns include that the Detainee Inquiry does not guarantee the full and effective participation of victims and the fact that it cannot compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documentation. For further information regarding Amnesty United Kingdom: Detainee Inquiry terms of reference and protocol fall far short of human rights standards (Index: EUR 45/011/2011) 04 August 2011.  23 The Justice and Security Green Paper can be accessed here: http://consultation.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/justiceandsecurity/ (accessed 21 November 2011). The Green Paper also puts forward a number of proposals to improve oversight of the security and intelligence agencies which are valuable.  24 For example, see the proposals which would allow closed material procedures to be used in civil cases for damages where the government is alleged to have been involved in human rights violations. In addition, the proposals seek to limit the role of the courts in a party, particularly into foreign legal proceedings (via so-to obtain disclosure of information from a defendant who is mixed up in arguable wrongdoing of a third party and was notably used in the Binyam Mohammed litigation. One of the proposals in the Green Paper is to introduce legislation which would remove the Norwich Pharmacal jmaterial held by or originated from one of the Security and Intelligence Agencies there would be an absolute exemption from disclosure. If this were to be implemented it would effectively close down the possibility of victims of human rights violations relying on the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction to access material concerning those violations when the security and intelligence agencies are involved. In light of the allegations of UK involvement in human rights violations of individuals detained overseas in the context of counter-terrorism operations, in which the agencies are implicated, the attempt to further restrict legal avenues to access material concerning human rights violations becoming public gives rise to serious concern.     25 briefing by Amnesty International UK section, published 7 July 2011.

2,AKC - AdEd Knowledge Company LLP," 1  Submission to the Universal Periodic Review by the U.N. of the UK   AdEd Knowledge Company LLP (research and popular adult education with Gypsies and Travellers and Roma)  Executive Summary This submission from a specialist  not for profit social enterprise outlines the serious breaches of the Human Rights of the Gypsy and Traveller and Roma minorities in the U.K.It includes examples and case studies from the research and education provision of the AdEd Knowledge Company and recommendations for future public policy.  1. Gypsies and Travellers:Present context in England 1.a The pictures of riot police tasering Irish Travellers at Dale Farm in Basildon on a site which was situated on their own land have been beamed throughout Europe and beyond.The British government officially sanctioned and financed the eviction and it was carried out by the local state and police.It highlights the historical survival and revival of anti Gypsyism in the U.K. and throughout Europe.The Roma are the largest minority in the E.U.and there have been a number of reports,directives, over many years from the PACE (Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe) and the U.N, documenting the survival of racism in the implementation of laws and provision of public services. The U.N. specifically warned the U.K. government and Basildon council that  the Dale Farm eviction trampled on the established human rights of the Irish Traveller residents and owners of the site.As the EHRC put it in a commissioned research report in 2009 Gypsies and Travellers everyday experience as legally defined ethnic minorities is feeling pervasive and corrosive impact of experiencing racism and discrimination through an entire lifespan, and in employment, social and poli 1.b Despite the Human Rights Act and the status of Romany Gypsies and Irish Travellers as ethnic minorities under the legal systems of both England and Wales and Scotland the Westminster Coalition government is continuing the policy of encouraging evictions of Romany Gypsies and Irish Travellers from sites developed on their own land  the Minister in England has recently sanctioned another eviction at Meriden.New legislation  will criminalise Gypsy and Traveller legal aid from Gypsies and Travellers who contest their evictions in court.(2) 2. Common sense racism, polliticians , the media and anti-Gypsyism 2.a Politicians who speak out in support of the human rights of Gypsies and Travellers in England are extremely rare, and many exploit prejudice against them particularly at elections (3) 2.b attracting 8.2 million viewers was widely seen by Romany Gypsy and Irish Traveller people as derogatory and reproducing inaccurate stereotypes of their cultures.(see the publication   2 www.travellerstimes.org.uk ).The general racist imagery current around Gypsies and Travellers in the British media has been well documented.In 2010 the attempts by Irish Catholic Travellers and other Catholic Gypsies and Travellers to see the Pope preach in Birmingham were described in terms of threatening insects. - The Pope's visit to Britain has been thrown into turmoil amid fears swarms of gipsies will turn up hoping to meet him. (The Sun newspaper August 26th 2010) 2. c Little seems to have changed since the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Gil-Robles said of the U.K. in November 2004. Gypsies would appear to be the last ethnic minority in respect of which openly racist views can still be acceptably expressed.  2.d Around the time of the Dale Farm eviction a story broke in the press from the police that they had uncovered an extensive criminal gang of Irish Travellers who were forcing homeless people into slavery(November 2011) four Irish Traveller men from the same family are in custody awaiting  as yet untested in court. 2.e AdEd Knowledge Company Romany Gypsy students in Norfolk in 2011  gave personal examples of challenging these media stereotypes: One Romany Gypsy man with generations of relatives living in Norfolk had liaised with local journalists to discover and publicise in the local media Romany Gypsy nvolvement in the two World Wars.One young Romany Gypsy man had Traveller culture 3.  3.a ts in the U.K. around 4,000 in Rotherham and Sheffield.(4) Again there is evidence of discrimination in immigration,housing and employment human rights which is challenged by campaigners and by  trade unions with members in this community.Roma families from other E.U. countries who have come to the U.K. in growing numbers since 2004 have.also been the victims of the virulent anti Gypsyism of the U.K. media. 3.b A recent (October 13th 2011) report in the Daily Mail about a BBC TV documentary is typical. The modern-day Oliver Twists: Child beggars as young as FOUR making £100,000 a (as in ) the Charles Dickens novel in which the villain Fagin forces a group of young children to extract cash from rich Londoners for him.   3  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2051482/Child-beggars-young-making-100-000-year-gypsy-gangs.html#ixzz1dpRChAq8 Which neatly conflates modern Anti-Gypsyism with historic Anti-Semitism against the Jew, Fagin. 3 c. Roma homes and people have been physically attacked in the U.K. in Northern Ireland in June 2009 and Romanian Roma evicted from their homes and back to Romania (See Pure Hate Travellers Times June 18th) and there are signs that conflict there is rising again.There have been attempts by the U.K. government to deport Roma E.U. found in Norfolk evidence from agencies that there were probably nearly a hundred unemployed migrant workers from the  E.U., including Roma, and fenland avoiding the authorities, fearing deportation. 4.The importance of Human Rights in theory and in practice for Gypsies and Travellers 4.a In relation to the experience of Gypsies and Travellers the interconnections between human rights, equality and anti-discrimination are central particularly in their rights to culturally sensitive accommodation and equal access to rights under planning laws.In England there have been successful campaigns and legal challenges in the past based around the Human Rights Act and ECHR case law.The Westminster government was forced  in 2009 to increase the rights of Gypsies and Travellers on their sites by giving them the same rights as occupiers of caravan sites in general.This was a result of a case (Connors v Leeds City Council) which originated in protests over an eviction at a Leeds City Council site. 4.b The site was one where a partner of the AdEd Knowledge Company (Marion Horton) had worked as a community development consultant esearch in Leeds over the years has shown prejudice against Gypsies and Travellers in health and education, and a real need for extra plots  very few have been provided.(5) Research around 2007/8 with Gypsy and Traveller Accomodation Needs Assessments for the whole of Yorkshire  demonstrated needs (including the new needs of European Roma from Slovakia,the Czech Republic etc.) which have only rarely been addressed in any meaningful way. (6) 4.c Gypsies and Travellers are a tiny minority (probably in the U.K. between 200,000 and 300,000 in all, the majority in bricks and mortar).Of those who have managed to retain a travelling culture only a minority are without sites. and Traveller population could be legally accommodated if as little as one square mile of 7).The fact that this has not happened is evidence of an irrational public policy  based on a racism which denies Gypsies and Travellers their human rights.    4 5. Rights to social development 5.a Some of the basic aspirations of the U.N. Millenium Development Goals (2008) including the reduction of child mortality, the improvement of maternal health and combatting disease are applicable to some Gypsies and Travellers whose experience of having no access to water and or sanitation and lacking access to health care,can reflect that of peoples study of transient (constantly travelling) families in Leeds in 2004,and AdEd Knowledge earch in 2007/8 which documented this important deficit in infant mortality, health care,longevity, and access to clean water. 6. Rights in the Criminal Justice system 6.a Research has documented the experience of Gypsies and Travellers of  discriminatory use of surveillance, information gathering and sharing, threats, disruption, eviction and spatial exclusion by the police in conjunction with other authorities.(EHRC 2009)There is a widespread stereotyping of Gypsy and Traveller people as being engaged in criminal activity, and well documented blanket mass police raids on sites with discriminatory checks on car and lorry licences which Power (8) and others have noted as a common route for Gypsy and Traveller men into the criminal justice system. 6.b Gypsy and Traveller male students in Norfolk in 2011 reported in discussions and course assignments a constant process of being stopped at the roadside for checks, and one student suffered constant harrassment of this kind on or near his land where he was in the process of applying for planning permission for a site 6.c The EHRC reported research on legal and probation reports which constantly insinuated that a nomadic lifestyle or living in caravans suggested criminality,reflecting an unspoked bias and prejudice which affected granting of bail,sentencing, and treatment (EHRC 2009) 6.d An Irish traveller male student successfully engaged on an official AdEd Knowledge and Chartered Institute of Housing national housing certificate course in 2011,  was detained and arrested after voluntarily attending a police station to check on reports that the police had made accusations against him. He appeared before a magistrate who heard evidence that the fact that he lived on an official local authority site made him unlikely to answer to bail conditions.When he protested that the court subsequently only appeared on video exchanges with the court system. 6.e On remand the prison authorities systematically frustrated the attempts of the Course Tutor to telephone him and visit him to enable him to continue his studies.When the student had completed assignments and given them to prison officials for a visit of the tutor they were removed from correspondence given to the tutor.Local lawyers and court officials assumed the criminality of Irish Travellers and openly   5 reviews of bail and remand would fail  as they subsequently did. The tutor was frustrated by local legal advocates from involving specialist barristers in Gypsy and Traveller cases who actually were involved as speakers on the course.The student was given a non-custodial sentence but has not been able to complete the course. 7. Recommendations 7.a During the 2008 UPR for the U.K. the U.N. Human Rights Council did not, at its hearings on the U.K., in 2008 make specific recommendations with regard to the Human Rights of Gypsies and Travellers and Roma..Subsequently the UNHRC has become involved in cases like the Dale Farm eviction and has been very critical of the U.K. Government..Our submission will no doubt echo evidence submitted by the National Human Rights agency in the U.K. to the UNPR, the EHRC. New public policies based on human rights 7 b Between 2007 and 2010 the previous Westminster government made progress in recognising the rights of Gypsies and Travellers in the planning and housing sytems but these have been reversed by the Coalition government.In terms of fundamental changes necessary in public human rights policies with Gypsies and Travellers and Roma we would strongly recommend that the administrations in England,Scotland and Northern Ireland follow the recent example of the Wales Parliament 7.c In Wales there has recently been a political initiative by the Welsh government based on their understanding of the human rights of Gypsies and Travellers.In Wales the d of September 2011 is . es and traditions. Gypsy and Traveller culture and heritage forms part of this diversity ... (the policy framework) sets out a nt to Gypsies and Travellers and our continued commitment to equality issues, community cohesion and human rights in 9)      6  References  Referred to throughout as EHRC 2009 2 Detailed references for facts in previous paragraphs may be found in John Grayson http://www.irr.org.uk/2011/november/ha000009.html 3th 2010 http://www.irr.org.uk/2010/june/ha000020.html  4.

3,AMIS - Abused Men In Scotland,"          Abused Men In Scotland                                                           Unit 1F6 Eric Liddell Centre Edinburgh   EH10 4DP Confidential Helpline 01383 62 44 11             Registered Scottish Charity SC041467                  Email: info@abusedmeninscotland.org Website: www.abusedmeninscotland.org    Abused Men In Scotland (AMIS) contribution to the Universal Periodic Review in relation to the UK.    AMIS (Abused Men in Scotland) is a registered charity in Scotland dedicated to supporting men who are experiencing, or who have experienced, domestic abuse.  AMIS has been consolidating its presence as a provider of support and as a source of information and awareness-raising for MSPs and professionals in the field including police, social workers, council and government officials and other charities.   AMIS runs a telephone helpline for men who have experienced domestic abuse, staffed entirely by trained volunteers, 7 evenings a week and much of our insight into what we have perceived as a significant area of human rights deficit in Scotland is drawn from the experience of the individuals who have contacted us through the helpline as well as dialogue with police, social workers, voluntary agencies and legal professionals.  AMIS works with any man over 16 concerned about domestic abuse, regardless of sexuality, age, dis/ability or ethnic origin. We welcome calls from men in immediate need of support or information and from men and women seeking help for male friends or relatives, or an understanding of what male friends or relatives may be experiencing.   In working for recognition of the needs of men who experience abuse, and of the needs of their children, AMIS does not seek to minimise the harm done by domestic abuse directed towards women.  AMIS supports efforts to challenge and eradicate domestic abuse directed against women whether from male or female perpetrators.    From our experience we would, however, urge that in addition to the challenge faced by all individuals and society as a whole in relation to domestic abuse the particular definition of domestic abuse adopted by the domestic abuse and the development of support services has resulted in violation of several Articles of the European Convention of Human Rights.  The dominant position of the definition1 and the reluctance of public authorities to engage with its limitations has affected three areas in particular that we will discuss below:  1. Men who suffer domestic abuse 2. Treatment of allegations of domestic abuse 3. Child contact issues  We will be very happy to provide further information on these interlaced areas.  In addition to the official statistics we would refer anyone interested in the question of the treatment of men in Scotland experiencing domestic abuse to our website  www.abusedmeninscotland.org                                                   1 -based abuse) can be perpetrated by partners or ex-partners and can include physical abuse (assault and physical attack involving a range of behaviour), sexual abuse (acts which degrade and humiliate women and are perpetrated against their will, including rape) and mental and emotional abuse (such as threats, verbal abuse, racial abuse, withholding money and other types of controlling behaviour such as isolation from family and   and to the following articles .2  We consider first the relevance of human rights to all forms of domestic abuse and then the specific, additional problems created by the Scottish   All forms of domestic abuse The perpetration of domestic abuse affects not only the primary individual target but also any children of the family, the wider family and society as a whole.  A country that fails to challenge domestic abuse cannot claim to be one which respects human rights. Domestic abuse violates many Articles of the Universal Declaration.  These Articles3 are commonly violated by the individual perpetrators of domestic abuse and in so far as the state fails to provide effective, accessible                                                  2 -15; B Dempsey egal Journal 116-Neutral Laws and Heterocentric Policies: ""Domestic Abuse as Gender-Based Abuse and Same--405 3  Article 1.

In the year 2009/10 there were a total of just under 52,000 reports of domestic abuse to the police in Scotland4.  Of these, almost 42,000 were reports from women in mixed-sex relationships.  There were also just over 8,500 reports by men who had experienced domestic abuse (7,938 in mixed-sex and 666 in same-sex relationships) constituting 15% of the total.    Since the Scottish Government statistical series began in 2000-01 the number of incidents recorded by the police with a female victim has increased by 42%. Over the same period, incidents recorded by police with a male victim  increased by 233% (2011 figures yet to be published).                                                                                                                                              Article 17. (1) Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others.  (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.   Article 19. Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.  Article 20. (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.   Article 29. (1) Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.  4 Scottish Government, Statistical Bulletin, Domestic Abuse Recorded by the Police in Scotland 2009-10  The Scottish Crime and Justice Survey, 20105 indicates that approximately 1 in 4 cases of domestic abuse against women appear to come to the attention of the police in Scotland while the figure is 1 in 8 for men experiencing abuse so the numbers being reported to the police reflect significant underreporting in relation to female victims but even more extreme underreporting in relation to male victims.  In spite of these figures showing a significant problem of domestic abuse against men, with the impact that has on their children, the Scottish Government has marginalised these victims of domestic abuse in terms of media response and funding of services.    The Scottish Government states it has spent £55m funding domestic abuse public information campaigns and services promoting the message that  the existence of abuse against men and in same-sex relationships is often istently ignored to the extent that they are not mentioned even in a footnote).    Over the same period we believe less than £30,000 (less than a tenth of 1%) has been allocated to organisations providing a service specifically designed to support men and their children who are affected by domestic abuse.  We make clear that we do not seek any reduction in funding for organisations supporting women victims of either male or female partners but call for greater recognition, in publicity campaigns and in terms of funding appropriate organisations, of the needs of men and their children.  aside the issue of under-reporting) we consider that they, and their children, deserve a response from the state which does not marginalise their                                                  5 http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/12/03094109/8  experiences.  We know that every year thousands of men, in mixed- and same-sex relationships take the courageous step of reporting that abuse to the police.  Even if these men and their children are a minority, it is entirely unjustifiable to say that attending to their needs should wait until the needs of another group are dealt with. We know of no other area of criminal law where sub-dividing victims of similar criminal behaviour is deemed to be acceptable.  In light of this we submit that there is evidence of failure on the part of the Scottish Government to effectively address the specific articles below in relation specifically to 1. men who experience domestic abuse whether in mixed-sex or same-sex relationships, 2. their children and 3. their wider family and friends and that this also has a significant deleterious impact on society as a whole.  Article 2. Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social  Article 7. All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.     We strongly support the principle that there should be no discrimination in relation to the Declaration.  For the reasons noted above we submit that there is a clear case of failure to avoid such discrimination in relation to the experiencing domestic abuse based on their sex, which results in men, whether trans, bisexual, gay or heterosexual being denied recognition and access to appropriate minimum protection and services and 2. against children based on the sex of the abused  parent or carer which results in  those children with male carers who are experiencing abuse being denied recognition and access to appropriate minimum protection and services.  2. Treatment of Allegations of Domestic Abuse.  Article 9.  No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.   Policies which impose a presumption or even requirement of arrest are controversial and AMIS does not have a firm conclusion on that issue.  However, we have heard both from men (and family members) and from senior police officers of pressure on police ocalled out to an incident where domestic abuse is alleged and that due to a number of factors where the incident involves a mixed-sex couple it is usually veral nights in police cells until the next court sitting.   Lord Carloway in his review of Scottish Criminal Justice in November 2011 has depend on what day of the week you are arr  In many cases we know the man is released without charge having lost liberty for several days. The post Cadder requirements for legal advice before interview are often sidestepped because no formal interview takes place. On other occasions even if charged by the police the case may be dropped by the Crown. Even when charged and prosecuted he may be acquitted but bail conditions in the interim effectively prevent contact with his children. Our concern is that in the politicised area of domestic abuse an allegation is taken as tantamount to evidence. This is a situation that is itself open to abuse and disproportionately affects men in the Scottish environment where the public narrative and the majority of training assumes domestic abuse is  something that men do to women. It is our experience that domestic abuse is about the abuse of power within a relationship regardless of gender.  offence.   Article 10.  Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.  Article 11. (1) Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.  In Scotland police officers, prosecutors and the judiciary are given training  the changing of behaviour and attitudes of these public servants and therefore raises concerns about the independence and impartiality of tribunals.   Article 16. (1) Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.   marriage.  Presumptions as to who is likely to be a victim of domestic abuse in a particular relationship which underpin the training provided to and the approach of state actors such as the police, social workers and the judiciary which are drawn from estimates of prevalence of abuse in relation to sex,  gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or any other factor clearly violate the requirement for equality of rights.    3. Child Contact issues   Article 8  Right to respect for private and family life  1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home  and his correspondence.  2.There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this  right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a  democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the  economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime,  for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and  freedoms of others.  It is our experience that there is an institutional bias against men in terms of the procedures and attitudes to child contact after divorce or separation or where the parents have never lived together.   Although the overriding ethos of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 correctly states that the interests of the children are paramount it is our experience that control of the contact between a child and a non-resident parent (in the considerable majority of cases, the father) is in itself exerted as a form of domestic abuse by the parent with residence.  Non-resident fathers often express to us that they are repeatedly asked to prove their worth as a parent and though contact orders have the force of law there is no effective means of enforcing them. They report that they are asked questions both in court and by court appointed reporters questions about their character that are never asked of the parent with care.  The burden placed on non resident fathers to prove their worth to fulfil the obligations placed on them in terms of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 would be avoided by a presumption of shared parenting as exists in several countries. Sweden is the best known and Switzerland is about to follow. The UK Supreme Court ruled in K v Principal Reporter that it is as much an abuse of the child's right to family life as it is to the father's when state has not been established and cannot be established when the parent with care is given an effective veto on contact.  Conclusion  All three areas identified above are known to the State in Scotland. We do not think Scotland should congratulate itself on its human rights record until these are addressed and the discriminations rooted out.  Article 30. Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein.  As stated above, AMIS is not and never has been against the effective challenging of domestic abuse directed towards women.  Any argument that the measures which marginalise men who experience domestic abuse and their children and so deny them their human rights are somehow necessary in pursuance of any aspect of the Declaration are unfounded and specifically nullified by Article 30.

Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities [1995] Article 6 [1]: The Parties shall encourage a spirit of tolerance and intercultural dialogue and take effective measures to promote mutual respect and understanding and co-operation among all persons living on their territory, irrespective of those persons' ethnic, cultural, linguistic or religious identity, in particular in the fields of education, culture and the media.                                                                                                   Introduction  1. Article 12 in Scotland believe that governments, professionals, and the wider community all have a role to play in building an environment that respects, values and validates the contributions of young people. 2. Our work is underpinned by the principle of free participation: the right to participate as equal citizens at all levels of society without fear or favour, and a process that facilitates the participation of all young people on their own terms and according to their own realities.  A principle that, if realised, facilitates informed choice, freedom, dignity, respect and demonstrates an acceptance that young people have the same human rights entitlements as adults: that age or ability is no exception, that there is no glass ceiling that deflects those who have not come up through the ranks of established participatory structures or those who do  3. We work to achieve this by supporting some of the most marginalised young people, such as young Gypsy/Travellers, young people looked after by the state and young people experiencing mental ill-health to, inter alia, undertake research to identify needs and concerns relating to their participation rights, and have those needs and concerns given due weight and attention by key decision makers at local, national and international level.        3  Context and purpose  4. The situation for Gypsies/Roma/Travellers in the United Kingdom [UK] is often not viewed to be as acute as the situation for Gypsies/Roma/Travellers in Eastern Europe.  However, in consultation with young Gypsy/Travellers in Scotland, it is clear that they feel largely excluded from mainstream society.  Additionally, despite Gypsy/Travellers having ethnic status in the UK, their experience is that it often favours and listens to the claims of those who enjoy full citizen rights, something which they, as a result of age and ethnicity, feel they are often denied. 1 5. The 2008 ubmissions to the 1st Universal Periodic Review: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland notes that inequalities continue to affect persons belonging to minority ethnic communities [...] and that [...] negative and inaccurate reporting by certain sectors of the media is contributing to hostile attitudes towards certain groups, in particular Gypsies and Travellers.2  6. This submission aims to demonstrate the lack of improvement [for Gypsy/Roma/Travellers] since the 1st Universal Periodic Review and argue that the significant and persistent inequalities affecting the Gypsy/Roma/Traveller communities will not reduce until systems are in place that afford Gypsy/Roma/Travellers and their advocates a legal right of redress to the growing negative and inaccurate portrayal of their community by certain sections of the mainstream media.  The role of the media 7. Negative media reporting is an issue which impacts upon the Gypsy/Roma/Traveller community not only on a Scottish/UK-wide level, but also internationally.  Gypsy/Roma/Travellers experience prejudice, discrimination and harassment on a global scale, which is in part fuelled by the media  thus implementing negative stereotypes and instilling the image of Gypsy/Roma/Travellers as criminals in the mind of the wider settled community. 8. Here in the UK, Gypsy/Roma/Travellers continue to be regularly vilified by certain representatives of the British media, and, although Article 12 in Scotland does not claim that all UK publications, programmes, radio shows and so on deliberately mislead the public and strive to criminalise the Gypsy/Roma/Traveller population, we do know that some do.  This deliberate misrepresentation [via leading words  etc. and the use of archive/stock photos] of an already marginalised community is not only unethical  it also serves to put a whole community in danger; women and children included.                                                             1 Article 12 in Scotland [May 2010], Getting it Right for Young GyOn line at: http://www.article12.org/pdf/Survey%20report_final.pdf 2 OHCHR [2008], ubmissions, II.

Send them to Hazelhead [crematorium] where the final solution is obvious. 3 10. In addition, anti-Gypsy/Roma/Traveller groups are prolific on social networking sites; unfortunately as soon as one of such pages is reported and removed, another springs up in its wake.  It is worth noting that despite their content violating social networkconditions, the removal process can take weeks or in some cases the pages are not removed at all.  called hungary, hungary gypos. [sic]4  ce, it should be, I mean there is no law in against shooting dirt and there less than that so it should be ok. 5  11. As with any community, a minority may break the law, however, the media focus on some of the more negative aspects of the Travelling community, and a lack of engagement with the community itself fuels stereotypes and encourages tension between Gypsy/Roma/Travellers and the settled community.    Power to the tax-payer, not the law breakers  any reasonable person must despair at the antics of the gypsies, who have given nothing back to society.  No-one in Britain should have to put up with nuisances such as anti-capitalists and gypsies [sic]6 [...] Following their eviction, the travellers have moved on to desecrate another neighbourhood  and continue to raise their children in feral conditions, not caring whether they can read or write, and not even making them attend school for the education which they argue is their right [sic] 7  12. A seemingly innocuous article in The Press and Journal, a daily publication in Scotland, entitled There are all sorts of ways to give people a bad name8 is just one example of the media campaign against Gypsy/Roma/Travellers in the UK.                                                                                                                    3 , Press and Journal on line [July 2010].

This article leads you in with a commentary concerning a respectful silence at a Scottish football game, harmless enough, but half way through it turns into an anti-Roma diatribe; the commentary includes: You having your ears assailed by some swarthy bloke playing the Romanian national anthem on his accordion. [...] Within minutes, they had hobbled and wheeled themselves off in every direction in search of kind-hearted Dubliners. [...] The worry is that, with the dire collapse of the Irish economy, these gangs will set their sights on Scotland. Thanks to the diversity training that the Scottish constabulary have been undergoing of late, in which they have been taught to treat these travellers with the utmost respect, the beggars could clean up over here with impunity.[...] If anyone dares to criticise them, they will probably find themselves up on a charge of inciting racial hatred.  Perhaps I should start  [sic]. 14. In their resource for the media, the Equality and Human Rights Commission rightly state: negative portrayal of the Gypsy/Roma/Traveller community serves to validate the idea that somehow Gypsy Travellers are fair game that it is not racist to stereotype or discriminate against a Gypsy Traveller [sic].9  Further, it is noteworthy that despite the resource advising that Gypsy/Traveller should always be capitalised [to denote ethnic status] out of a sample study of 87 Scottish publications, covering each local authority area in Scotland, Article 12 in Scotland found that only 2% of those sampled used capitals.  Fairer reporting, which gives due regard to ethnic status, would go a long way in improving relations between the two communities.

Like any other ethnic group, Gypsy/Roma/Travellers are a diverse people, and a vulnerable group in the hands of the media. Consultations with Young Gypsy/Travellers have identified negative and inaccurate media reporting as a key driver of discrimination towards their community.                                  16. Young Gypsy/Travellers involved in Article 12 in Scotland research10 have identified that more often than not the media will refer to ethnicity when reporting on crime when it involves Gypsy/Roma/Travellers.

Further, they felt that media portrayals of Gypsy/Roma/Travellers were to blame for division and segregation from the settled community, increased prejudice and discrimination and served to galvanise inaccurate, widely held social beliefs about their culture.  The media targets us, there is never anything positive said about Travellers and they always stereotype us. It makes people who read the papers judge us.

Comparing these findings with previous research; [...] of 109 young Gypsy/Travellers interviewed by Save the Children [Scotland] in 2005,11 84% reported that discrimination was the same or worse than in 2001.  a thing that will never go away, just because we are Travellers  ask them why? - and commentary from others with an interest in ensuring that rights and equalities are a reality for Gypsy/Roma/Travellers in the UK - press may argue that they are merely reflecting standard public opinion, and that may be right.  But in reflecting it they condone, encourage and confirm racist assumptions whereas, some might argue, it is part of their role to counter such bigoted simplifications12 -                                                                                                            consolidates our view that, in terms of the negative and inaccurate portrayal of the community by certain sections of the mainstream media, little has changed Gypsy/Roma/Traveller communities since the 1st Universal Periodic Review.       19. The current media code of practice,13 which essentially advocates the negative commentary provided it is directed at a community rather than an individual, fails the community and we are convinced that Gypsies/Roma/Travellers will continue to be portrayed negatively until government legislates to ensure that the media give due regard to the human rights and ethnic status of the Gypsy/Roma//Traveller communities in the UK.                                                              11 Save the Children Scotland [2005] Having our Say. 12 Morris, R., [2000]: Gypsies,

5,ARTICLE 19 - ARTICLE 19,"THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITIAN    For consideration at the thirteenth session of the UPR Working Group, May 2012   Executive Summary  1. ARTICLE 19: Global Campaign for Free Expression (ARTICLE 19) is a UK-based international, non-governmental human rights organisation established in 1986 that works around the world to protect and promote the right to freedom of expression and information, erformance in implementing established freedom of expression standards. ARTICLE 19 has observer status with ECOSOC. 2. With this submission, ARTICLE 19 seeks to make a constructive contribution to the preparation process of the UPR for the United Kingdom (UK).  Given the expertise of ARTICLE 19, this submission focuses on UK compliance with its international human rights obligations in respect of freedom of expression and freedom of information, in particular:   Restrictive legislation relating to accessing information through the internet and other information and communications technologies;  Failure to reform defamation laws;  Continued misuse of the Official Secrets Act to limit public interest speech;  Excessive surveillance laws which allow for retention of information and monitoring of communications with little oversight;  Weaknesses in providing public access to information;   including criminal defamation, blasphemy, and on implementation of the Freedom of Information Act, 2000.  3. actions to address them.  Limits on Internet Access  4. There has been a growing demand on internet services providers to limit access to content  using various means.  These restrictions are coming from both public and private sources.  ARTICLE 19 is concerned that these efforts are chilling freedom of expression online and are being done without legal process.  5. The Digital Economy Act 2010 requires that internet service providers (ISPs) establish a 'copyright infringement list' of subscribers based on claims by copyright holders. ISPs are required to take technical measures against the subscribers, including slowing down or suspending their internet access completely, when they have been accused of infringing copyright a certain number of times. This process of determining the infringements takes place without any independent legal process before the decision is made and only limited appeals after. The Act also allows for copyright holders to petition a court to order the blocking of websites accused of providing access to a ""substantial amount"" of copyright infringing content. 6. ARTICLE 19 believes that the Act is a disproportionate response to the problem of online copyright violation. It creates a mechanism for restricting or suspending internet access which will have a wide impact, chilling the speech of individuals and households, well beyond that necessary for protecting intellectual property. It unfairly shifts the burden to subscribers to prove that they did not commit the infringement and that they ,  while not providing adequate safeguards for innocent providers or defining what the measures need to be taken. This creates legal uncertainty for subscribers which will result in innocent subscribers facing sanctions and many small providers stopping offering services. This will be especially problematic for those offering public internet access including libraries, schools and cybercafés. 7. There are also efforts to limit access to information and internet domains using informal processes. At the urging of the police, Nominet, the domain name register, is currently considering a new rule to allow it to freeze domain names at the request of police without a court order. According to Nominet, there were over 2,600 seizures of domain names between October 2008 and April 2011 conducted without court orders. 8. There have also been suggestions by authorities on limitations of social media. Following the London disturbances in 2011, Prime Minister Cameron suggested that police be given the powers to shut down social media sites and services.  9. There have been other recent incidents resulting in the removal of online content and the placing of restrictions on access to websites without legal authority:  Website Fitwatch.org.uk, which monitors police abuses, was taken down in November 2010 after a police officer acting without a court order contacted the web host and demanded its removal and the seizure of its domain name on the basis  that it was ""attempting to pervert the course of justice"".    The domain name for website ihateryanair.co.uk, which provided public commentary critical of airline Ryanair, was seized based on commercial law claims in October 2010.    In January 2009, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a group set up by ISPs to create a list of blocked sites, orderMachine, which prevented many UK-based users from accessing any of the 85 billion pages in the system.   ISPs reportedly regularly voluntarily take down materials under the Terrorism Act of 2006 when contacted by the authorities but no records are kept on the practice.  10. ARTICLE 19 believes that these cases show the weaknesses of  the legal protections available to internet users and information providers where informal non-legal means are used to restrict access to information. We believe that all restrictions on access including takedowns, filtering, blocking and seizure of domain names need to be based on a legal process to be compliant with the ICCPR.  Defamation  11. In the 2008 UPR report, the Council recognised a substantial number of areas where UK defamation law infringes freedom of expression. These included and conditional fees.  There has been only limited progress in this area.  ARTICLE 19 considers this lack of process to be a serious problem with profound effects on freedom of expression.  12. The Government introduced its draft Defamation Bill in March 2011 and it is expected to be considered in 2012. However, the bill does not address many of the problems noted by the Council in 2008.  There is also currently a review and effort to reform fees. The European Court of Human Rights in Case of MGN Limited v. The United Kingdom (Application no. 39401/04), recently  freedom of expression. In addition, the courts have made decisions on jurisdiction and on enhancing protections for public interest journalism.   13. While the reforms and cases have been welcome, many problems remain. Libel is still frequently being used to stifle public debate on issues of important concern. Some of the recent cases include:  In January 2011, the NGO Soil Association was threatened with defamation for submitting comments in a public consultation opposing the opening of a new larger-scale pig farm.    The British Chiropractic Association brought a case against science writer Simon Singh for defaming its members in April 2008 after Dr. Singh wrote a column criticising many of their claims as lacking scientific evidence. The case was finally dropped in April 2010.  However, Dr. Singh legal costs were not fully covered, leaving him paying extensive legal fees.    Twitter was forced in May 2011 to identify anonymous individuals who had criticized officials at the South Tyneside Council. The case was brought by the Council using public money.  While it was claimed that the allegations were defamatory, no further case was brought against the persons identified.   14. There is a particularly severe problem with defamation cases brought against internet users and intermediaries. Under the current system of notice and takedown, ISPs typically remove all material which has been challenged immediately out of concern of being held liable for the material themselves. There is no legal process and often this results in a large amount of material removed from online.  15. There is also continued problems over the issue of libel tourism where cases with little or no connection to the UK are brought in UK courts for defamation. In December 2010, the Kyiv Post banned access by UK-based individuals to their website following a case brought against them by a Ukrainian businessman. The case was dismissed in February 2011. International concern over the practice has resulted in the US Congress enacting the Securing the Protection of our Enduring and Established Constitutional Heritage (SPEECH) Act in 2010 which prohibits UK libel judgements from being enforced in US courts.  16. There has been some positive developments which should also be recognised. The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 repealed the common law crimes of blasphemy and blasphemous libel and the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 repealed the criminal offences of sedition and seditious libel, defamatory libel, and obscene libel.   Prohibitions on Reporting  17. There were a number of cases where the courts issued injunctions prohibiting the disclosure of information by news media.  In a number of cases, the court issued orders extending the publication ban to information that orders had even been issued, commonly known - 18. In 2010, the High Court prohibited the Guardian newspaper from publishing information, including on the injunction itself, relating to waste in Ivory Coast. Newspapers reporting on a parliamentary debate on the subject were also threatened. 19. Following the public revelation of these cases, the UK Government convened a review, chaired by Lord Neuberger, the Master of the Rolls, which recommended that their use be strictly limited.  20. ARTICLE -injunctions are a violation of Article 19 of the ICCPR and that all injunctions need to be strictly limited.    Official Secrets Act  21. The Official Secrets Act, which includes provisions originally adopted in 1911, criminalises the unauthorized release of government information in broad areas. In 2008, the Council expressed concern over its use to limit release of information of public interest and recommended it be limited in its use to cases where the information would be   The recommendation followed previous recommendations in 2000 and 2001 from UN bodies on reforms to the Act to better recognise freedom of expression concern. 22. ARTICLE 19 believes that the OSA has been frequently used against government whistle-blowers and the media for printing information relating to the security services.  In the past several years, the Act has been cited in controversial cases involving the public interest. These include:  In 2011, police demanded that The Guardian newspaper reveal the identity of confidential sources who provided information relating to police incompetence in their investigations of News International. The demand was dropped following public outcry.   In November 2008, MP Damian Green was arrested and his parliamentary offices searched by anti-terrorism police for receiving and releasing to the media documents from a source in the Home Office on poor performance on immigration.   Access to Information  23. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 set up procedural rules on access to information held by public authorities. The FOIA exempts all information from security services and also provides for  a ministerial override. These exemptions allow for withholding of information in cases of important public interest including relating to torture and rendition. 24. There was also a serious concern about implementation, with excessive delays in both responses by public bodies and by the appeals body, the Information Commission. In the past year, there has been good progress in reducing delays at the Information Commission. However, there are continuing problems with many public bodies on providing access to information in a timely manner.  25. There also remain continued problems with individual access to their own records.  Under Article 17 of the ICCPR, individuals have a right to protection of their family and personal life. The Council in General Comment 16 has stated that this includes a right to access and to correct personal information held by government and privacy bodies. The Data Protection Act, 1998 gives individuals a right to demand and correct information. However, there is no effective appeals mechanism.  The Information Commissioner is not given the power to hear appeals in these cases even though it is the appeals mechanism for both data protection and FOIA. Individuals must bring cases before courts which is prohibitively expensive. This results in it often being easier to obtain non-personal information from public bodies.  ARTICLE 19 believes that is a serious limitation to the right of information and the right of privacy as protected by the ICCPR.   Data Retention and Surveillance  26. ARTICLE 19 remains concerned about public authority use of surveillance to monitor communications as a violation under Article 19 and Article 13 of the ICCPR. The Data Retention (EC Directive) Regulations 2009 regulations require communications providers to retain communications data on all users for 12 months, including mobile-phone location and e- mail logs. There is no requirement that the users are being investigated or even considered to have committed a crime and there are no exemptions for information that is otherwise protected, including that of the communications and mobile phone location data of journalists and their sources.  27. Government agencies access this information through the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), which covers the interception of communications; the acquisition of communications data, including billing data; intrusive surveillance, such as on residential premises or in private vehicles; covert surveillance in the course of specific operations; the use of covert human intelligence sources like agents, informants, and undercover officers; and access to encrypted data. It requires that communication providers maintain interception capabilities, including systems to record internet traffic on a large scale. 28. RIPA allows national government agencies and nearly 500 local bodies to access communication records for a variety of reasons, from national security to tax collection. Orders for interception and access to content of communications require approval from the Home Secretary or another secretary of state, rather than an independent judicial officer. In 2010, there were 552,550 requests for communications data from telephone companies (including mobile-phone service providers) and ISPs. The law has been used against journalists to obtain their phone records and identify their sources in a number of cases.   Recommendations  29. In response to these concerns, ARTICLE 19 calls on the UN Human Rights Council to make the following recommendations to the UK Government:   Repeal provisions of the Digital Economy Act which allow for the cutting off of internet users and the blocking of web sites;  Ensure that all limits on access, blocking, filtering and takedowns of internet materials are judicially authorised and based on international freedom of expression exemptions;  Reform the Official Secrets Act to only apply to cases involving substantial harm to national security. It should also be reformed to include a public interest defense;  Reform libel law to including limitations on libel tourism, increase public interest defences and limit excessive fees;  Repeal Data Retention (EC Directive) Regulations 2009;  Reform Data Protection Act to ensure individuals have access to personal information held by public and private bodies.   Adopt new rules which ban the per-discussion that a case even exists.

6,ASI - Anti Slavery International," 1  Submission for Universal Period Review of the United Kingdom 13th Session, 21 May  4 June 2012.  Information on submitting organisation: Anti-Slavery International, established in 1839, works to eradicate all contemporary forms of slavery; bonded labour, forced labour, human trafficking, descent based slavery, the worst forms of child labour, and forced marriage.  Executive summary: This submission focuses on trafficking for forced labour and sexual exploitation, and the abuse and exploitation of migrananti-trafficking practice is not compliant with its international obligations and deficient in the areas of identification, protection and prosecution.   1. Trafficking in the UK The Government1 estimates that there are 5000 people trafficked to the UK at any one time. Between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2011, 1481 potential trafficking victims were referred to the exploited as adults and 24% as children, 72% were female and 28% were male. Those referred came from 88 different countries. Victims originated from Nigeria, China, Vietnam, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the UK in the greatest numbers. Nearly half of adults were trafficked into sexual exploitation (46%), with 30% trafficked for labour exploitation and 18% for domestic servitude2. Children were trafficked for labour exploitation (34%), sexual exploitation (29%) and domestic servitude (13%).3 The number of referrals to the National Referral Mechanism is not a true reflection of the extent of trafficking in the UK. Many trafficked people are not referred into the system, primarily because they did not see the benefit or were fearful of the consequences.4   The legal framework and policy response Trafficking for all forms of exploitation is a criminal offence in the UK and carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 introduced a new offence of holding someone in slavery or servitude, or requiring them to perform forced or compulsory labour, punishable by a maximum of 14 years imprisonment. The Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 established a system for registering labour providers in the agricultural, shellfish gathering and associated packing and processing sectors. The UK ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings in 2008. In May 2011 it opted in to the EU Directive on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings and Protecting Victims. In July 2011, the Government launched its new anti-trafficking strategy with four key aims; international action to stop trafficking happening; a stronger border at home to stop victims being brought into the UK; tougher law enforcement action to tackle trafficking gangs; and improved identification and care for trafficked people.5                                                   1 House of Commons Home Affairs  Select Committee, The Trade in Human beings: Human Trafficking in the UK, Home Affairs Committee, Sixth Report of Session 2008-9, Volume 1, House of Commons, London, May 2009 2 The remaining victims were encountered prior to the exploitation beginning 3 The remaining victims were encountered prior to the exploitation beginning  4 The Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group, Wrong kind of victim?, June 2010 5 , July 2011, http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/crime/human-trafficking-strategy?view=Binary      November 2011   2 Failure to identify, protect and prosecute   Flawed identification system Under the National Referral Mechanism, two designated Competent Authorities can determine a -EEA cases and the UK Human Trafficking Centre in EEA cases. There is no formal appeals process against the decision of these bodies. Between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2011, 1481 potential trafficking victims were referred to the National Referral Mechanism. Of these, a total of 497, just 33%, received a Conclusive Positive Grounds Decision; the formal term for identification as a trafficked person. Given that the Government itself estimates that 5,000 people are trafficked to the UK at any one time, this figure is surprisingly low. There are concerns regarding differential treatment of victims depending on their immigration status.6 A breakdown of positive decisions by country of origin reveals a startling disparity between the chances of UK and EU nationals, and non-EU nationals, to be recognised as trafficked. Eighty six percent of UK nationals referred were positively identified and 77% of Romanian nationals. Despite non-EU nationals representing the largest proportion of victims, positive identification was extremely low, just 15% of Chinese and 19% of Nigerian nationals.   According to the Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group, the system appears to be relying excessively on the discretion of officials, who receive minimal training, to staff a mechanism supported by flawed legal guidance relating to who should be identified as a trafficked person.7 In numerous cases, the authorities concluded that as the person had agreed to come to the UK, they could not have been trafficked despite the fact that under international law, deception and abuse render any consent irrelevant. The failure to identify victims has serious consequences; a trafficked person can only exercise their rights once officially identified.   Inadequate services for victims of trafficking Failures within the identification process compounded by a lack of formal service standards have resulted in barriers to victims in accessing services they are entitled to, including accommodation, medical services, counselling and legal assistance. The level and quality of assistance varies widely depending on the type of exploitation someone has been subjected to, their location, and the capacity of support providers. Some trafficked women have been housed in unsuitable places and accommodation for male victims of trafficking is severely limited. Services such as interpreters or legal representations are routinely not available.8 Although there are four avenues available under UK law through which trafficked persons could seek compensation, they face numerous practical and legal barriers in accessing this right and are highly unlikely to receive compensation.   Criminalising victims of trafficking Trafficked people continue to be treated as criminals rather than the victims of a serious crime. Despite existing guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service, victims of trafficking are often not identified as such and are routinely prosecuted for offences they committed when coerced.  In the case of R v O, 2008,9 the Court of Appeal overturned the conviction of a Nigerian girl who had been trafficked into prostitution yet was successfully prosecuted and sentenced to eight months imprisonment for using an identity card belonging to another, which she had been using whilst trying to escape her trafficker. In recent years the police have discovered numerous cannabis farms, many of them located in private houses. Often the adults or children encountered during the raids had recently arrived from other countries, notably Vietnam, and there were good grounds for                                                  6 The Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group, Wrong kind of victim?, op.cit 7 Ibid 8 Ibid 9 EWCA Crim 2835, 2008, http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2008/2835.html   3 considering that some had been trafficked. However, while the authorities seem to have recognised that they had been subjected to pressure, the individuals were prosecuted nonetheless.   Low levels of prosecution and convictions  In October 2009, the Home Office and Scottish government reported that, since 2004, there were 113 convictions for trafficking for sexual exploitation, seven for trafficking for forced labour, and three for conspiracy to engage in trafficking. There was one conviction in Scotland and the one trafficking conviction in Northern Ireland was overturned. There were 116 prosecutions on trafficking charges between April 2010 and March 201110, the outcome of these is unknown. Anti-Slavery International is aware of at least three convictions in 2011; one individual was sentenced to 11 and a half years imprisonment, one to twenty years imprisonment and one awaits sentencing.11  Several factors are leading to such low levels of prosecution and convictions: a failure to investigate after a presumed trafficked person provided a statement, particularly in cases of migrant workers subjected to domestic servitude; a lack of understanding of the various forms of coercion associated with trafficking, particularly debt bondage, among law enforcement officials; a lack of resources at local police level to conduct relatively expensive trafficking investigations; and a lack of information sharing among the different agencies involved. In the case of OOO & Ors v The Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis, 201112, the High Court found that the Metropolitan Police had failed to investigate the claims of four individuals who had been trafficked to the UK from Nigeria when they were children and subjected to forced labour as domestic workers. They were subsequently awarded compensation.   Proving a human trafficking crime is difficult. Between April 2009 and January 2010, 36 individuals arrested for trafficking offences in England and Wales went to court. Although all 36 were arrested under the relevant trafficking legislation, nine were convicted on charges related to the exploitation of prostitution.13 In effect, law enforcement officials found it easier to secure convictions on these charges rather than on more serious charges related to trafficking. The Government is reviewing whether current trafficking legislation supports the effective prosecution of traffickersthere are some disparities which make the legislative framework less straightforward than it could be for prosecutorsthe different levels of proof required mean that it is more difficult to prosecute for labour exploitation.14  Lack of co-ordination of anti-trafficking efforts  There is no formal coordinating body on anti-trafficking action in the UK. While the UK Human Point of co-ordination for the development of expertise and cooperation to 15, it does not have actual operational coordination authority. Numerous agencies have a role to play in protecting or assisting trafficked persons. Yet so far the government has had difficulty in establishing any meaningful form of coordination between these nternal borders.   An immigration approach to trafficking new anti-trafficking strategy appears to be serving the agenda of curbing migration rather than protecting victims and prosecuting traffickers. It pays very little attention to                                                  10 , op.cit 11 Data supplied to Anti-Slavery International in October 2011 by the Crown Prosecution Service 12 EWHC 1246 (QB), 20 May 2011, http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2011/1246.html 13 Freedom of Information request 20090647 answered by UKHTC on 18 January 2010, accessed on 6 April 2010 and available at www.southyorks.police.uk/foi/disclosurelog/20090647-0  14 ,  op.cit, p23 15 Website of the UKHTC accessed August 2011   4 internal trafficking, focuses predominantly on international trafficking and immigration control measures as tools to combat trafficking, and offers little for the protection of trafficked people. This over-focus on international trafficking and immigration control measures is at odds with the referral statistics where UK and EU nationals represented over half of conclusively identified victims, and fails to take account of the fact that people can be trafficked through regular migration channels or may have a legal right to be in the country.   Child victims of trafficking The UK is failing child victims of trafficking. Although a strong child protection framework exists in the UK, the National Referral Mechanism bypasses those with child protection expertise, and the decision on whether a child is identified as trafficked is made by those who have insufficient expertise on child trafficking.16 The locations in which many trafficked children may be found, such as in a brothel, cannabis factory or forced into street crimes, result in many being treated as criminals rather than victims of crime. Many separated children who are placed in local authority care go missing.17 There is evidence that some respond to pre-arranged orders to rejoin their traffickers (or others) who subsequently exploit them. While there is a pilot guardianship scheme for all separated children in Scotland, other UK authorities have so far not taken action to appoint legal guardians for trafficked children. As a result, no one individual is responsible for accompanying the child through all the legal and other administrative procedures and upholding the   2. Migrant domestic workers In 2010, approximately 15,000 visas were granted to domestic workers from non-EU countries to accompany their employers to the UK.18 Migrant domestic workers, the vast majority of whom are women, are a particularly vulnerable sector of the UK workforce. Living as well as working in their , they are extremely isolated and are subjected to a variety of coercive mechanisms. Each year, hundreds face situations of abuse, exploitation and forced labour. In 2010, 56% of the migrant domestic workers registering with Kalayaan19 received a salary of £50 or less per week, 48% worked 16 hours or more a day, 67% worked seven days a week with no time off psychological abuse, 18% to physical abuse and 3% to sexual abuse. The passports of 65% were withheld by the employer and 60% were not allowed out of the house unaccompanied.20  The legal framework The Overseas Domestic Worker (ODW) visa was introduced in 1998. Employers wishing to bring domestic workers to the UK are required to prove that there is a 12 month pre-existing employment relation and must provide an employment contract. Crucially, the visa is an independent immigration status for the domestic worker and is not tied to the employer (except for those working for diplomats). Migrant domestic workers are able to change employers to another domestic work position in a private house, and thus are able to escape exploitative conditions without fearing becoming irregular. The visa is also renewable.   Protections for migrant domestic workers under threat Despite the scale and seriousness of the abuses that migrant domestic workers face and the positive outcomes the existence of the visa has had in helping them to escape exploitation, in June 2011 the                                                  16 The Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group, Wrong kind of victim?, op.cit 17 ECPAT UK, Watch over me, London, October 2011, pp13-14 18 UK Border Agency statistics 19 A charity that works with migrant domestic workers in the UK, www.kalayaan.org.uk 20 Lalani, M, Ending the Abuse. Policies that work to protect migrant domestic workers, Kalayaan, London, May 2011    5 Government announced a three month consultation on employment related settlement. Within this are proposals to abolish the ODW Visa and replace it with a non-renewable 6 or 12 month visit visa, with no employment rights, no right to change employer and no eligibility for settlement. No decision had been announced by November 2011. However, should the proposals go through, the UK government will remove one of the single most important protections for migrant domestic workers, leaving hundreds vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and forced labour with no escape route. The ODW visa has been shown to work well and has been recognised internationally as an example of good practice.21 The UK Home Affairs Select Committee stated that retaining the visa single most important issue in preventing the forced labour and traffic22   The specific vulnerabilities of migrant domestic workers accompanying diplomats In 2010, 50% of migrant domestic workers in diplomatic households in the UK received a salary of less than £50 per week, 53% worked 16 hours or more a day, and 63% worked seven days a week with no time off. Furthermore, 47% reported psychological abuse, 11% were subjected to physical abuse and 6% sexual abuse. The passports of 58% were withheld and 63% were not allowed out of the house unaccompanied.23 Domestic workers in diplomatic households are excluded from protections currently afforded to other migrant domestic workers. The UK operates a visa system that allows diplomats to bring domestic workers to the UK. This visa specifies that these domestic workers are unable to change their employer outside of the specific mission that sponsored the visa. Visas are issued to domestic workers coming to the UK to work for diplomats with almost no oversight. There is no requirement to prove a pre-existing employment relationship or to provide an employment contract. Domestic workers in diplomatic households are therefore particularly vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and forced labour. They cannot leave their employer without suffering serious sanctions such as becoming undocumented and potentially being removed from the UK.   3. Recommendations to the Government  3.1 Trafficking  Restructure the National Referral Mechanism so that it acts as a multi-agency identification and referral mechanism, and introduce the right to appeal into the process;  Ensure that all trafficked people in the UK are able to access the support and services that they are entitled to, including free legal aid and access to their right to compensation;  Ensure that no victims of trafficking are prosecuted for crimes that they committed while being trafficked;  Appoint an independent anti-trafficking watchdog, based on the model of the Dutch National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings, with statutory powers to request information from the police, the immigration authorities, social services and NGOs across the UK, and to report to parliament;  Introduce a system of guardianship for child victims of trafficking to ensure that every child has someone with legal authority to take decisions based on their best interests. 3.2 Migrant Domestic Workers   Ensure that migrant domestic workers are: recognised as workers under UK law; have the right to change employer, including those in diplomatic households; are able to apply to renew their visas; and have the right to apply for settlement;  Sign and ratify ILO Convention No189 on Decent Work for Domestic Workers.                                                  21

The registered address is 207-221 Pentonville Road, London N1 9UZ. Review response    2     1. Introduction  Age UK is the new force combining Age Concern and Help the Aged. We are working for a better later life today and tomorrow. We celebrate ageing and work to create opportunity in later life. And we fight and challenge disadvantage and unfairness wherever we find it.   Every day Age UK is in touch with thousands of people who we support to speak up for themselves. We understand the change that is needed to transform vision for our ageing society.   Age UK is very pleased to have the opportunity to comment on the UK   This report details the most significant areas where the human rights of older people in the UK are abused. It also reporting on the human rights situation of older people to the UN human rights treaty bodies.      2. Key Points and Recommendations   The UK Government should:  2.1. Protect the 1998 Human Rights Act  (HRA) and ensure any changes emanating from the Bill of Rights Commission build on the rights and enforcement mechanisms in the HRA.  2.2. Reframe the debate on human rights in the UK emphasising the valuable protection it provides to older people at their most vulnerable.  2.3. Extend the protection provided by the HRA to older people by ensuring that providers of residential and homecare services are regarded as public authorities regardless of who is funding the service provided.   2.4. Use existing human rights treaties more effectively to safeguard the human rights of older people and significantly improve its reporting of the situation affecting older people when making submissions to UN human rights treaty bodies.          3  3. Progress since the previous report  3.1. The last universal periodic review included the recommendation that the UK 1. The UK Government accepted this recommendation.  3.2. In the mid-term review the UK Government reported that it was introducing legislation which would outlaw age discrimination against the over 18s in the provision of goods and services and introduce an integrated public sector equality duty (PSED). This legislation was introduced in the 2010 Equality Act.    3.3. Age UK welcomes this legislation having campaigned for many years to combat the age discrimination which affects tens of thousands of older people on a daily basis. We are however concerned by the wide ranging exemption on financial services that has been introduced and the lack as yet of regulations needed to ensure the relevant provisions are in place as promised by April 2012.  3.4. However despite this legislation and the HRA, the human rights of older people in the UK continue to be regularly infringed. Numerous reports have documented the breaches that occur particularly in relation to health and social care. For example the recent report by the Parliamentary and Health Service ombudsman highlights examples of older people suffering unnecessary pain, indignity and distress while in the care of the NHS, specifically a lack of dignity, poor nutrition, poorly planned discharge from hospital and personal care, staff attitude and poor communication. 2  4. Article 2  Right to Life  The most serious instances of malpractice and abuse in health and social care settings can   4.1. Malnutrition in hospitals and care homes  4.1.1. Successive reports have found that older people do not always receive appropriate food and drink or get the needed help with eating. In 2010 Age UK found the number of people leaving hospital malnourished increased from157,175 in 20078 to 185,446 in 200893. In addition 239 patients died because of malnutrition in English hospitals in 2007, although because malnutrition is under-reported, the true figure may be much higher.4                                                   1 Recommendation 10  2 Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (2011) Care and Compassion?

Patients were not given the help they needed to eat, meaning they struggled to eat or were physically unable to eat meals. Patients were interrupted during meals and had to leave their food unfinished. The needs of patients were not always assessed properly, which meant they didneeded. Records of food and drink were not kept accurately, so progress was not monitored.5   4.2. Abuse of anti-psychotic drugs  4.2.1. A study found that 40% of people with dementia in care homes are prescribed neuroleptic drugs.6 Neuroleptics are not licensed for use in dementia care but have become part of routine treatment, despite evidence on the increased risk of death.7   4.2.2. In 2008, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia completed an inquiry into the prescription of anti-psychotic drugs as a means of sedation in care homes and found it to be widespread despite guidance to the contrary.8   4.2.3. Paul Burstow, the Secretary of State for Social Care, recently said that anti-psychotic drugs prescribed against the evidence, without clinical justification, amounted to a deprivation of liberty and warned that prescribing needs to be cut by two-thirds.9  5. Article 3  Right to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment  5.1. Age UK is aware of many cases of older people being treated in ways which :  5.2. them of their dignity and respect. People were spoken over and not spoken to; people were left without call bells, ignored for hours on end, or not given assistance to do the basics of life  10  5.3. Action on Elder Abuse estimates that 324,000 older people are subject to abuse at any one time in the UK.11 They have documented many cases of                                                  5 Dignity and nutrition inspection programme p4 Care Quality Commission  October 2011 p14 6 Margallo-Lana, M et al, (2001) Management of behavioural and psychiatric symptoms amongst dementia sufferers living in care environment.

Despite being blind, her meals and drinks were left on a trolley - in most cases without her being alerted. For the most part, staff also did not offer any assistance with eating or drinking. As a result, many of the meals were removed untouched. Mrs S also suffered a great indignity when she asked for a commode, but was told by a nurse that she could use her incontinence pad. Staff frequently talked over her and about her rather than to her in the mistaken belief that she was unable to talk for herself.13  6. Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life, home and correspondence  The protection offered by Article 8 is of particular importance to older people.   6.1. Use of the toilet in private Many older people have their privacy violated when they use the toilet in hospital or care homes. The British Geriatrics Society reports of older people being forced to use commodes and bed-pans in wards when they could have gone to the toilet with assistance, older people being left on commodes/bed-pans for unnecessarily long periods of time, patients being left in view of others when using toilets, and staff entering closed curtains without ascertaining why they were closed. The eight hospitals had serious failings in staff respecting 14   6.2. Older couples being separated in different care homes Age UK is aware of incidences of older couples being separated by sending them to different care homes or by moving a person into a care home but not allowing their partner to join them.   Case study  A husband and wife had lived together for over 65 years. He was unable to walk unaided and relied on his wife. She was blind and used her husband as her eyes. They were separated after he fell ill and was moved into residential care. She asked to go with him, but was told by the local authority that she did not fit the                                                  12 Action on Elder Abuse (2004) e, London 13 Age Concern (2008)  On the Right Track? 14 Dignity and nutrition inspection programme p11 Care Quality Commission  October 2011   6  criteria. S our years and for it to happen now, when we need each other so much, is so upsetting. I am lost without him  aunched by the family and various human rights experts and organisations, argued that the local authority had s right to respect for family life. The authority agreed to reverse its decision.15    6.3. Homecare The Equalities and Human Rights Commission is currently investigating how well the home based care system in England is protecting the rights of people over 65 and the report will be published in November 2011. It uncovered cases including people being left in bed for 17 hours or more between care visits, failure to wash people regularly and provide people with the support they need to eat and drink and people being left in soiled beds and clothes for long periods. 16 7. Current Gaps in protection  7.1. Currently only those older people whose residential care costs in private care homes are met by the local authority are protected by the HRA. Those people who fund their own placement remain outside its protection. Age UK believes that all older people in residential care should be covered by the HRA regardless of who is funding the placement.  7.2. Older people who receive publicly funded homecare from independent home care providers are also not protected by the HRA as independent home care providers are not public authorities for the purposes of the HRA. We are concerned that where older people are arranging care without the involvement of the local authority there is little oversight of how their human rights are being protected. Age UK believes that independent home care providers should fall under the remit of the HRA.   8. Reporting to UN Human Rights Bodies  8.1. Age UK carried out a systematic review17 of twenty one reports presented by the UK Government to the UN human rights treaty bodies since 1995.18 The review analysed the the effectiveness of existing human rights treaties for meeting the needs of older people.                                                   15 BIHR (2008) The Human Rights Act  Changing lives, 2nd edition 16 EHRC Press release 20 June 2011 17 The unpublished Age UK review carried out in October 2011 is available upon request. 18 The review analysed reports available electronically submitted to the following bodies since 1995: CAT, ICCPR,ICESCR, CERD, CEDAW, as well as the Universal Periodic Review. The analysis excludes reports on Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories.   7  8.2. The research found little or no substantive reporting on the human rights situation of older people across all of the reports. References to age were made in the broader context of equality with regards to equalities legislation and did not address specific abuses of human rights for older people.  8.3. For example, General Comment 2 of the Convention Against Torture makes explicit reference to protecting the human rights of older people should prohibit, prevent and redress torture and ill-treatment in, inter alia, institutions that engage in the care of the agedf the rights abuses detailed elsewhere in this report.  8.4. The research also found a consistent lack of disaggregated data on older people across all of the reporting to all of the treaty bodies.  8.5. In addition to the UK Government needing to strengthen human rights protection for older people, considerable attention must be paid to using existing human rights instruments and treaty bodies more effectively.   9. Threats to Human Rights in the UK  9.1. One of the main threats to human rights within the UK is the hostility which is frequently displayed by the media and some politicians including ministers and even the Prime Minister to the Human Rights Act   9.2. In July 2006 the Department for Constitutional Affairs Review of the Implementation of the Human Rights Act highlighted the myths and misperceptions that surrounded the HRA. It found that the HRA was widely misunderstood by the public and that a number of damaging myths had taken root in the popular imagination. It advised the Government to ensure that the public was better informed about the HRA.   9.3. In the five years since that report these myths and misconceptions have not only persisted but have become more firmly entrenched. There is little evidence that any Government has ensured better information is available. A recent poll found that fewer than 1 in 10 people can remember ever receiving or seeing any information from the Government explaining the HRA.19   9.4. We believe the UK Government should educate the public about the HRA and how it has and can be used to protect the rights of everybody, including older people against human rights abuses by the state. There are practical ways to encourage a more positive environment in which human rights can be promoted and the UK Government should leading this.  9.5. Our experience is that when people are given information they readily understand the relevance and value human rights have for them. Age UK and the British Institute of Human Rights recently undertook a three year project to empower older people to use human rights. The project offered local groups training and advice on using human rights arguments to influence services and                                                  19 Human Rights Survey conducted by ComRes for Liberty, September 2010   8  policy. All the groups found that once people have been given information and training they easily understood how human rights principles and legislation applied to their daily lives. By the end of the project, the participants had improved their knowledge and understanding and were confident to use human rights arguments to challenge public agencies or to campaign on specific local issues. 20                                                     20 Older People and Human Rights Project Evaluation Report p 21 Age UK and BIHR Sept 2011 ",english,"review nov right reserv third

Our vision is of a Northern Ireland in which respect for human rights is integral to all its institutions and experienced by all who live there.  Our mission is to secure respect for human rights in Northern Ireland and to disseminate the human rights lessons learned from the Northern Ireland conflict in order to services are available, free of charge, to anyone whose human rights have been violated because of the conflict, regardless of religious, political or community affiliations.  BIRW take no position on the eventual constitutional outcome of the conflict.    Please note: References to recommendations refer to the original recommendations of the Human Rights Council, and not to the re-numbered recommendations accepted by the United Kingdom (UK).   NOVEMBER 2011     1 Dealing with the legacy of the Northern Ireland conflict  1. Northern Ireland is in transition from a protracted period of internal conflict in which over 3,500 people lost their lives and many thousands more were injured.  Despite setting up a Consultative Group on the Past, which produced a detailed report recommending a Legacy Commission for Northern Ireland, the UK has failed to provide any effective mechanism for dealing with the legacy of the conflict, particularly in relation to contentious deaths.    2. There are three principal mechanisms in existence which provide some scope for dealing with such deaths: inquests; the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) and the Police Ombudsman (PONI).    3. In the case of McCaughey1 the Supreme Court ruled that all inquests must comply with the procedural requirement for an effective investigation inherent in the right to life (A. 3 UDHR).  However, there is a serious backlog for hearing inquests into contentious deaths and inquests cannot be said to provide a prompt remedy.    4. The HET is located within the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and is answerable to its Chief Constable, and cannot therefore be said to comply with the requirement for independence.  Neither is it prompt, as its review of deaths arising from the conflict has only reached 1975 so far.    5. PONI is  in disarray, following the resignation of the Ombudsman himself and key senior staff after NGOs including BIRW exposed the fact that the office was allowing the police, whose work is supposed to be scrutinised by PONI, to censor its reports into contentious deaths.  Following a damning report by the Criminal Justice Inspectorate (CJI), all historical investigations by PONI have been suspended.  The Chief Constable of the PSNI, Matt Baggott, has refused to accept that he is bound by the findings of the Police Ombudsman, asserting that he must endorse or agree with judgements [of the Ombudsman].  BIRW has complained to the Policing Board of Northern Ireland concerning this refusal to be held to account by the PSNI.  6. The only other mechanism for dealing with contentious deaths is that of an inquiry.  BIRW consider that the Inquiries Act 2005 undermines the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and human rights protection, and therefore fails to provide for effective, independent, impartial or thorough public judicial inquiries into serious human rights violations.  This is because, instead of inquiries being under the control of an independent judge, they are controlled in all important respects by the relevant government minister.  Under the Act, the Minister decides whether there should be an inquiry, sets its terms of reference, can amend its terms of reference, appoints its members, can restrict public access to inquiries, can prevent the publication of     2 evidence placed before an inquiry, can prevent the publication of the costs of any part of an inquiry which strays beyond the terms of reference set by the Minister.  However, in the Baha Mousa Inquiry, the Minister undertook not to exercise his powers to intervene, which meant that in many respects it was compliant with the requirement for an effective investigation; although, as in the Northern Ireland cases of the Robert Hamill Inquiry and the Billy Wright Inquiry, also held under the 2005 Act, the family of the victim were not consulted about the terms of reference of the inquiry and inquiries under the Act do not have the power to attribute liability.  Collusion  7. Another outstanding issue arising out of the Northern Ireland conflict is that of collusion.  There is compelling evidence that throughout the conflict agents of the state, including soldiers, police officers and intelligence officers, colluded with both republican and loyalist paramilitaries.  Paramilitary organisations were infiltrated in the name of obtaining intelligence and saving lives, but murders and other criminal acts were allowed to take place without security force intervention in order to maintain the cover of infiltrated agents.  Such collusion was not the result of unauthorised acts by rogue individuals, but was the outcome of policies consciously adopted by successive UK governments and state agencies.    8. One such case, in which the UK Prime Minister recently admitted that collusion had occurred, was the 1989 murder of Belfast human rights lawyer Patrick Finucane.  In 2001 the UK and Irish governments agreed in the Weston Park Agreement to ask an international judicial figure to study six cases of alleged collusion, including that of Patrick Finucane and promised that, if this person recommended a public inquiry, an inquiry would be held.  Retired Canadian Supreme Court judge Peter Cory recommended inquiries in five of the six casethe UK has reneged on its commitment to hold an inquiry.  The UK, having said that it needed to change the law before it could hold an inquiry into his case, then introduced the Inquiries Act 2005.  The Finucane family resisted an inquiry that would have been under the control of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  However, they later revised their stance and said they would accept a Baha Mousa-style inquiry, with no ministerial interference.  In October 2011 they met the Prime Minister in the full expectation that they would be granted an inquiry.  Instead, the government announced its intention to appoint senior Counsel to conduct an on-paper review behind closed doors with no opportunity for the family to examine papers or witnesses.  This is a major failure in accountability on the part of the UK, with the potential to destabilise the peace process.        3 Prison issues  9. There has been some continuing violence in Northern Ireland and dissident paramilitaries continue to attack the security forces and the public.  Those security prison, HMP Maghaberry, where those awaiting trial are not segregated from convicted prisoners.  Paramilitary prisoners are separated from others for their own safety, which severely restricts their access to facilities such as education.  There is a power struggle taking place between these prisoners, who want effective control of their part of the prison, and the prison authorities.  These prisoners do, however, have some legitimate complaints about the oppressive use of strip-searching and severe limitations on their ability to associate with other prisoners.  An independent team of moderators achieved an agreement between the prisoners and the authorities in August 2010, which included modern alternatives to strip-searching, which BIRW regards are inhuman and degrading treatment (A. 5 UDHR), but so far the UK has failed to implement it.  Some thirty republican prisoners have been engaged in a dirty protest (destroying sanitation , refusing to wash, and smearing their excrement on cell walls) over the last four months.  At least two of these prisoners are seriously ill and the health of all tIreland and female prisoners are housed in a facility designed for young offenders.  One female prisoner charged with terrorist offences, Marion Price, is being held in isolation in the all-male Maghaberry jail because there are no high security provisions for female prisoners.  The situation in Maghaberry has the potential to destabilise the fragile peace process in Northern Ireland.  Counter-terrorism legislation  10. UK counter-terrorism law does not comply with human rights standards (Rec. 6, UK UPR). Following the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Gillan and Quinton2, the UK was forced to suspend the power to stop and search people without any need for reasonable suspicion of involvement in terrorism under the Terrorism Act 2000.  Terrorist suspects can be remanded without charge for up to 28 days and without access to bail (Rec.s 9 and 10).  A challenge to these provisions in the case of Duffy3 is pending.  In Northern Ireland, those charged with terrorist offences continue to be tried in the no-jury Diplock Courts, whereas in the rest of the UK a person charged with the identical offence would by tried by a jury.  Throughout the UK, adverse inferences can a refusal to testify at trial; these provisions undermine the privilege against self-incrimination and shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to defence, thus violating the right to a fair trial (A. 10 UDHR).  The Terrorism Act 2000 continues to permit the denial of access by terrorist suspects to legal advice for up to 48 hours (Rec. 8).      4 11. BIRW have noted with some dismay the introduction of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (SOCPA), which introduced a legislative framework for using the evidence of co-defendants against other defendants.  The few trials in the preparation for which SOCPA has been deployed have sometimes involved multiple defendants and/or multiple charges, and for this reason among others they have been liked to the single informer testified against multiple defendants.  These convictions almost all collapsed on appeal and brought the administration of justice in Northern Ireland into serious disrepute.  While SOCPA attempts to include a system of checks and balances, it nonetheless provides an incentive for offenders to lessen the penalties they would normally face, and an opportunity to settle old scores within the paramilitary underworld.  It also represents a failure of normal policing methods, often leaving victims with a sour sense that they were only able to achieve partial justice at the cost of seeing at least one perpetrator walk away with relative impunity.  Torture  12. The UK did not accept Recommendation 11 in full, because they would not accept that persons detained by the army were under UK jurisdiction.  The UK has now been over-ruled on that point by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Al Skeini4.  As in other instances mentioned in this submission, all too often it has been necessary to have recourse to the courts Baha Mousa Inquiry showed, the UK has failed to meet Recommendation 12 in terms of ensuring that specific policies and programmes to avoid violations in situations of armed conflict.  Indeed the case of Ali-Zaki Mousa5 shows that there are many victims of human rights violations perpetrated by UK soldiers policies and practices.  A large group of domestic and international NGOs including BIRW have refused to co-operate with the Detainee Inquiry, chaired by Sir Peter Gibson, who was the Intelligence Services Commissioner from 2006 to 2010.  The inquiry is meant to examine allegations of intelligence service complicity in torture of British detainees held at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere post 9/11.  This inquiry is a non-statutory inquiry, with none of the powers of compulsion of disclosure or witnesses conferred by the Inquiries Act 2011.  It will hear most of its evidence in secret, and will only hear from the heads of the intelligences services, rather than from operatives.  The victims of the alleged torture have themselves refused to co-operate with this sham of an inquiry.    13. The UK continues to deploy plastic bullets (AEPs) as a weapon of riot control in Northern Ireland.  Earlier versions killed 14 people, half of them children, and we remain concerned that if improperly used they have the potential to     5 cause fatalities.  In 2002 the Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concern about their use.  Tasers are also deployed throughout the UK, although not normally in riots, and they too are potentially fatal.  In 2008 the also concerned about the deployment of CS gas, which can cause lasting harm to people with respiratory problems or eye conditions.  The Bill of Rights  14. In December 2008 the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) finally delivered to the government the advice on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland which was ordained by the 1998 Good Friday/Belfast Agreement.  It was the result of very detailed consultation with all political parties and civil society throughout Northern Ireland.  It encompassed not only civil and political rights but also economic, cultural and social rights (Rec. 15).  Instead of acting upon the advice and fulfilling its commitment under the Agreement, the then government simply shelved it. The present government has sought to subsume the issue under a debate on whether there is a need for a UK-wide Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, which is a thinly-disguised attack on the Human Rights Act 1998, which gave effect to most of the European Convention on Human Rights in domestic law (excluding A. 13, which confers the right to an effective remedy). Northern Ireland needs a Bill UK, Northern Ireland is in transition from a sectarian conflict which led to a yawning human rights deficit.  Recent opinion surveys show that the Northern Ireland Bill of Rights gas strong public support.  Impunity of the intelligence services  15.  intelligence services operate secretly and are not subject to any public oversight, such as an ombudsman, nor are individual operatives held to account for their actions.  The UK will abandon criminal trials rather than allow intelligence operatives or operational methods to be exposed.  Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 a person can, for example, ask whether his or her telephone has been tapped, but will only be told that it is not possible to answer such a question, other than to say that, if the telephone is tapped, then such action has been authorised.                                                  1 In the matter of an application by Brigid

9,CAJ - Committee on the Administration of Justice," 1         S369  Submission to the UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW in relation to the United Kingdom 2012  November 2011                2  What is the CAJ?  The Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ) was established in 1981 and is an independent non-governmental organisation affiliated to the International Federation of Human Rights. CAJ takes no position on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and is firmly opposed to the use of violence for political ends. Its membership is drawn from across the community. The Committee seeks to ensure the highest standards in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland by ensuring that the government complies with its responsibilities in international human rights law. The CAJ works closely with other domestic and international human rights groups and makes regular submissions to a number of United Nations and European bodies established to protect human rights. - publishing reports, conducting research, holding conferences, campaigning locally and internationally, individual casework and providing legal advice. Its areas of work are extensive and include policing, emergency laws and the criminal justice system, equality and advocacy for a Bill of Rights. CAJ however would not be in a position to do any of this work, without the financial help of its funders, individual donors and charitable trusts (since CAJ does not take government funding). We would like to take this opportunity to thank Atlantic Philanthropies, Barrow Cadbury Trust, Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Oak Foundation. The organisation has been awarded several international human rights prizes, including the Reebok Human Rights Award and the Council of Europe Human Rights Prize.           3 Submission to the Universal Periodic Review of the UK 2012 1. Northern Ireland is a post-conflict society that remains deeply divided. The 1998 Belfast/Good Friday Agreement provides the framework for the main elements of the peace settlement. This includes a framework for the sharing of executive power between the two main communities, and a number of institutions and powers designed to protect human rights.  The 1998 Agreement is an international treaty between the UK and Ireland; and was also endorsed by referendum in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.1  A number of subsequent UK-Ireland bilateral Agreements implement and further the peace settlement.2  2. CAJ is concerned that despite being enshrined in an international peace treaty there are still a number of commitments made as part of the settlement that have still yet not been implemented, and others which were taken forward which have subsequently  been undermined. This submission will therefore focus remain unimplemented or threatened, in summary:     legislating for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland; [paragraphs 3-5 below]  threats to the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in Northern Ireland law; [6]  measures to facilit building, in particular the non-application of UNSC Resolution 1325 to Northern Ireland; [7]  holding an independent inquiry into the murder of human rights defender Pat Finucane; [8-9]  the undermining of the independence of the new police complaints ombudsman; [10-11]  the strengthening of equality and anti-discrimination legislation in Northern Ireland;[12]  the failure to discontinue a separate criminal justice regime consisting of counter-ialist courts; [13] The Working Group may wish to urge the UK to implement its outstanding commitments relating to the peace-process and protect elements of the settlement which are at risk.                                                                1 The Agreement consisted of the British-Irish Agreement between the two sovereign states and the Multi-Party Agreement between participant political parties. Both were done in Belfast on 10 April 1998. The British-Irish Agreement (Article 2) affirms the solemn commitment of the UK government to support and implement the sections of the Multi-Party Agreement which correspond to it. 2    4 Northern Ireland Bill of Rights 3. The 1998 Agreement provided for the UK Parliament to legislate for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland containing rights which were in addition to the ECHR, reflected the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland and drew on international instruments and experience.  In a further UK-Ireland bilateral agreement in 2003 the UK further explicitly committed to introducing legislation in the UK Parliament for the Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland once the National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) had delivered advice as to its content.3 After a long intensive consultation the NHRI submitted its advice to the UK Government in December 2008. The following year, in relation to this advice, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) stated:   The Committee notes the draft Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, which includes economic, social and cultural rights which are justiciable and calls for its enactment without delay.4   4. Whilst in 2009 the UK government later issued a consultation document5 it has not subsequently introduced nor taken steps towards introducing legislation for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. In 2011 the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed its concerns that despite the provisions of the 1998 Agreement the Bill of Rights had not been taken forward and recommended that the UK take immediate steps to ensure a Northern Ireland Bill of Rights was adopted.6   5. The Northern Ireland process is a separate commitment to more recent initiatives by the UK government in relation to a potential UK Bill of Rights.7  The Working Group may wish to urge the UK to implement its commitment to legislate for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.   Incorporation of the ECHR into Northern Ireland law 6. In the 1998 Agreement the UK committed itself to the incorporation of the ECHR into Northern Ireland law.  This included provisions for direct access to                                                            3 In 2003 the UK-Ireland Joint Declaration stated that once the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission delivered its advice on the content of a Northern Ireland Bill of Rights the British Government would bring forward legislation in the UK Parliament (Westminster) where required to give effect to rights supplementary to the ECHR to reflect the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, see Joint Declaration by the British and Irish Governments, April 2003, Annex 3, paragraph 2.  4 CESCR (Concluding observations on the UK) 12 June 2009, UN DocE/C.12/GBR/CO/5, at para10.   5 A Bill   6 CERD (Concluding observations on the UK) 14 September 2011, UN Doc CERD/C/GBR/CO/18.20, at para 19.  7 Further to discussions on a potential British Bill of Rights by the previous UK governme, p.11;) http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/cbr/index.htm this process has a very different genesis from the Northern Ireland process motivated by differing political agendas around constitution-building; making rights more British; linking of rights to responsibilities, and even proposed weakening of the ECHR.   5 the courts, remedies for violations, powers to strike down legislation, and prohibition on infringements by public authorities and the legislature.8 The UK then took these commitments forward through the Human Rights Act 1998 and Northern Ireland Act 1998. CAJ is concerned that the present UK discussions relating to a potential British or UK Bill of Rights have included advocating retrogression from the ECHR.9   The Working Group may wish to seek assurances there will be no retrogression from the incorporation of the ECHR.  The right of women to full and equal political participation in a post-conflict society 7. The parties to the 1998 Agreement affirmed, in post-conflict context, the right of women to full and equal political participation.10 However, whilst in this context it would be important to do so, to date the UK has adopted a position of not applying the provisions of the subsequent UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (on women peace and security) to the conflict in Northern Ireland.11 CAJ does not believe it is possible for the UK to sustain a view that UNSCR 1325, adopted unanimously by the Security Council (including the UK) with reference to all UN Member States, either only applies to the global south, or that Northern Ireland is not a post-conflict society to which the resolution should apply. CAJ sees clear relevance in the application of UNSCR 1325 to Northern Ireland. This is a view also put forward by the UN Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) who stated:   The Committee also calls for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) in Northern Ireland.12    The Working Group may wish to ask the UK to fully implement UNSCR 1325 to Northern Ireland.                                                               8 1998 Agreement: Rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, paragraph 2; strand 1 5(b-c), 11, 26(a). 9 Whilst the terms of reference of the present (UK) Commission on a Bill of Rights, reiterate commitments to the ECHR, this does not per se guarantee there is no advocacy of retrogression from the manner in which it is presently given further effect in domestic law through the Human Rights Act 1998 and Northern Ireland Act 1998 (and separate devolution statutes in Scotland and Wales).  10 1998 Agreement: Rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, paragraph 1. 11 The UK has adopted a position of not applying UNSCR 1325 to Northern Ireland.  Despite this the participation in peace building and political processes, are relevant to all states.  Also, the UK Government will continue to work towards increasing the representation of women in Northern Ireland see CEDAW, UK 7th Periodic Report) July 2011, at para 301. However the UK gave no indication of which particular initiatives the UK regards as taking forward.  12 CEDAW (Concluding Observations on the UK) 10 July 2008, UN Doc CEDAW/C/UK/CO/6, at para 285.   6 Independent inquiry into the murder of human rights defender Pat Finucane 8. In 2008 the Human Rights Committee, examining UK compliance with the ICCPR, stated that: The Committee remains concerned that, a considerable time after murders (including of human rights defenders) in Northern Ireland have occurred, several inquiries into these murders have still not been established or concluded, and that those responsible for these deaths have not yet been prosecuted. Even where inquiries have been established, the Committee is concerned that instead of being under the control of an independent judge, several of these inquiries are conducted under the Inquiries Act 2005 which allows the government minister who established an inquiry to control important aspects of that inquiry. ([ICCPR] art. 6) The State party should conduct, as a matter of particular urgency given the passage of time, independent and impartial inquiries in order to ensure a full, transparent and credible account of the circumstances surrounding violations of the right to life in Northern Ireland.13 9. Under the 2001 Weston Park Agreement the UK agreed to hold independent public inquiries into a number of high-profile conflict killings, if such inquiries were recommended by an independent international judge examining their cases.  Mr Justice Cory subsequently recommended inquiries in most of the cases. One of these recommendations related to the 1989 murder of leading human rights lawyer Pat Finucane, which had been the subject of a successful case to the European Court of Human Rights.14  After the Cory recommendations the UK introduced the Inquiries Act 2005 which, replacing all previous legal bases for an inquiry, provided for unprecedented interference by a government minister in the inquiry process.  Whilst inquiries into other killings have taken place the UK has not implemented its commitment for an independent inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane. In 2011 the UK, despite having indicated an inquiry would commence with undertakings that ministerial powers would not be exercised, instead retracted take place rather than an independent inquiry.   The Working Group may wish to ask the UK to implement its commitment for an independent inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.                                                             13 Human Rights Committee (Concluding Observations on the UK) CCPR/C/GBR/CO/6/CRP.1 21 July 2008, at para 9.  14 Finucane v the United Kingdom, [2003] ECHR 29178/95.   7 Undermining of independent Police Complaints Mechanism 10. Reform of policing, including independent accountability, was a significant outworking of the 1998 Agreement. This led to the establishment of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland as an independent body to investigate complaints against the police.  The requirement of investigations independent from the security forces is particularly relevant to conflict-related deaths where there is potential state involvement.  11. In 2011 three reports into the Police Ombudsman from three distinctly different institutions  CAJ, the Northern Ireland Justice ministry and official Criminal Justice Inspection, identified political interference in the Office.15  The Criminal Justice Inspection further determined: g cases were altered or rewritten to exclude criticism of the police with no explanation; senior officials in the Office requested to be disassociated from reports into historic matters after original findings were dramatically altered without reason; staff investigating some of the worst atrocities of the conflict existed investigations into a number of high profile atrocities. In September 2011 CERD took note of the reports of the current lack of independence of the Police Ombudsman and urged the UK to ensure the Office is able to undertake effective investigations.16 The Working Group may wish to ask the UK what steps it is taking to restore independence to   Equality and non-discrimination   12. Strengthening protections against discrimination and duties to promote equality were important tenets of the peace settlement, however there remain significant concerns. Non-discrimination and equality legislation is piecemeal and complex,17 as well as inconsistent and incomplete.18 Despite over ten e Equality Bill, commitments in the bilateral                                                            15 Human Rights and Dealing with Historic Cases- A Review of the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland (Department of Justice Northern Ireland, June 2011);   Office of the Police OmbudsSeptember 2011). 16 CERD (Concluding Observations on the UK) UN Doc CERD/C/GBR/CO/18-20 1 September 2011, at para 15. 17 There are over 80 pieces of equality and non-discrimination legislation in Northern Ireland. 18 For example, different levels of protection apply by reference to colour and nationality, as compared to race, ethnic and national origin.   8 Agreement 2006 and the passing of the Equality Act 2010 in Great Britain, no work is currently taking place to introduce harmonising legislation in Northern Ireland. In light of this in CERD have recently recommended that the UK take immediate steps to ensure that a single equality law is adopted in Northern Ireland (or the Equality Act 2010 is extended to the jurisdiction).19 In addition treaty bodies have expressed concerns a duty on public authorities to promote equality provided for under the 1998 Agreement is not being implemented as effectively as it could be.20  The Working Group may wish to ask the UK to strengthen equality and non-discrimination protections in Northern Ireland.  The continued u 13. The 1998 Agreement contained considerable commitments to a 21 However in 2011 there is continued application of both specific and UK-wide emergency legislation to Northern Ireland despite no emergency existing.  Contrary to the Northern Ireland do nstrate the effectiveness of the UK 22 Our 2008 submission to the UPR on the use of emergency legislation in Northern Ireland highlighted how human rights abuses can sustain and prolong conflict, alienate communities and undermine the rule of law.23 14. The Justice and Security Act (Northern Ireland) 2007 (JSA) provides for a range of emergency type powers in Northern Ireland. This includes provision for special non-jury trials in Northern Ireland, a provision which has been recently extended for a further two years.24 The JSA also provides the police and military with extraordinary stop, question and search powers, which can be exercised without individual reasonable suspicion (and hence in a potentially arbitrary and/or discriminatory manner).  These powers have                                                            19 CERD (Concluding Observations on the UK), UN Doc CERD/C/GBR/CO/18-20 1 September 2011, at para 19. 20 See CESCR (Concluding Observations on the UK), UN Doc E/C.12/GBR/CO/5, 12 June 2009, at para 31; Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (Concluding Observations on the UK), UN Doc CEDAW/C/UK/CO/6, 10 July 2008, at para 264. The statutory duty to promote equality of opportunity was domesticated under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  21 Security, paragraph 2(iii). 22 Paragraph 104. 23 War on Terror: lessons from Northern Ireland, CAJ, 2008 (www.icj.org/IMG/CAJ_summary.pdf) 24 measures (at para 104). CAJ has stated that there is no substantive body of evidence within the public domain to suggest that there is a serious problem of juror intimidation in Northern Ireland that would support the case for non-jury trials.   9 continued to be exercised despite use of similar UK-(Terrorism Act 2000) powers having been discontinued following a European Court of Human Rights ruling of incompatibility with the ECHR.25  The working group may wish to ask the UK whether it intends to repeal the emergency type powers in the Justice and Security Act (Northern Ireland) 2007 and UK-wide counter terrorism legislation.                                                            25 Gillan and another v United Kingdom [2010] ECHR 4158/05.

The Convention was ratified by the UK Government in 1991 and sets out these basic human rights for children in 54 articles and two Optional Protocols.   1.2 The legislature in Wales 1.2.1 In Wales, powers are vested in the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government owever, the UK Parliament and Government still have significant powers in relation to Wales and have considerable influence over Welsh affairs.1                                                             1 http://www.assemblywales.org/abthome/role-of-assembly-how-it-works.htm    2   2. Methodology   2.1 This submission is based upon the information gathered and research conducted via  2.2 It is also worth noting that much of the evidence within this submission has been gleaned and England.  3. Developments since last review  3.1 Normative and institutional framework  3.1.1 Proposal for a UK Bill of Rights  3.1.2 The UK Government has established an independent commission to examine the possibility of developing a UK Bill of Rights.   3.1.3  UK Bill of Rights would be welcomed only on the premise that a bill would build on existing rights and not represent a retreat.  3.1.4 We have advised the Commission that they should not entertain the concept of rights being accompanied by responsibilities. Any a retrograde step and represent an inherent inequality within the legislation.  3.1.5 Any Bill should encompass the rights enshrined in other international conventions and should specifically mention the UNCRC and its optional protocols.  3.1.6 The UNCRC contains a clear set of principles and standards to ensure children reach their full potential and comprehensively encompasses civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. The European Convention on Human Rights does not provide a sufficiently holistic set of rights which should be afforded all people. As such, a Bill of Rights could address these weaknesses, namely the lack of socio-economic rights.  3.1.7 The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child stated in its 2008 concluding observation: at the principles of the Convention are not duly taken into account in all pieces of legislation throughout the country and   3 that the state party has not incorporated the Convention into domestic law nor has ensured the compliance of all legislation affecti2  3.1.8 There also need to be careful consideration of the UK constitutional settlement and diverging policy context ny UK Bill of Rights would need to consider how to incorporate the linguistic rights of Welsh speakers in Wales considering the legal status afforded the Welsh Language. Linguistic considerations have applications across all human rights.  3.2.1 Equality Act  3.2.2 The Equality Act 2010 protects people from discrimination (direct and indirect), related harassment or victimisation and sexual harassment in a range of settings by reference to a range of protected characteristics, in relation to goods, facilities, services and public functions. Despite clear evidence of the discrimination children face, the Equality Act does not offer children and young people complete protection from discrimination on the grounds of their age. It means children and young people will be the only age group in society that will be discriminated against by this critical piece of equality legislation.   3.2.3 The general duties within the act relating to eliminating discrimination, advancing equality and fostering good relations between groups does not apply to schools or   3.2.4 The Equality Act however gave powers to the Welsh Government to introduce specific public sector duties in Wales. It is of utmost importance that consideration of the issues facing children and young people are given the attention they deserve during the implementation of these duties.     3.3.1 Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011  3.3.2 The National Assembly for Wales has passed groundbreaking legislation which obligates Welsh Ministers to pay due regard to the UNCRC and its optional protocols when undertaking Ministerial functions. There is also a duty on Ministers to promote and raise awareness of the UNCRC and also provisions for amending Welsh legislation if it were deemed incompatible with the UNCRC. oner for Wales                                                            2 http://www.childcomwales.org.uk/uploads/publications/277.pdf  3.2.5 Priorities for action: Under-18 year olds should be given comprehensive protection under the Equality Act against age discrimination  not withstanding the necessary and justifiable exceptions.     4 welcomes this development and will be monitoring closely the implementation and impact of the legislation.   3.4.1 General Measures of Implementation of the UNCRC   3.4.2 Currently, the  has a UK-wide remit regarding non-devolved issues, enabling her to exercise her functions in relation to children in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.   3.4.3 It is more appropriate, particularly from the point of view of the child, that each of the Commissioners in the UK is able to promote and protect all the rights of children in their own country, regardless of the subject matter.       4. UPR 2008 Recommendations  Human Rights Council, eighth session. Agenda item 6. 3  4.1 The following section focuses on particular issues which relate to recommendations made through the UPR process in 2008.      4.2 Equal Protection for Children - Smacking 4.2.1 Legislation is needed to provide for equal protection of adults and children against assault. Children are the only people in the UK who can be hit without consequence. Children should be entitled to the same level of protection as adults.    4.2.2 The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended in their concluding as a matter of priority all corporal punishment in the family, including through the repeal of all legal defences, in England and Wales, 4                                                             3 http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session1/GB/A_HRC_8_25_Add1_UnitedKingdom.pdf  4 http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/AdvanceVersions/CRC.C.GBR.CO.4.pdf  3.4.4 Priorities for action: amended so that all four Commissioners can promote and seek to uphold the rights of children in their own   UPR Recommendation 10: To consider further measures in order to address the problem of violence against children, including corporal punishment.1    5 4.2.3 In England and Wales, Section 58 of the Children Act 2004 removed the defence of to serious assaults, it may be used in relation to charges of common assault. The Children Act 2004 therefore fails to prohibit all physical punishment in the family.  4.2.4 The National Assembly for Wales has voted in favour of the non-binding motion:   Urges the Welsh Government to bring forward legislation for consideration by the Assembly whioffence of assaulting a child5       4.3 Youth Justice       4.3.1 The UN Committee on Rights of the Child had concerns in 2008 regarding youth justice including the age of criminal responsibility being too low, cases where children could be tried in an adult court, high rates of custody, high numbers on remand, children in custody not having the right to a statutory education, proposed removal of reporting restrictions for 16 and 17 year olds facing criminal proceedings, and the provisions of the Counter Terrorism Bill applying to children. Recommendations sought to address these issues and ensure that the State Party complied with international standards especially Articles 37, 39, and 40 of the UNCRC. 4.3.2 The Committee was concerned about Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) in particular the ease with which they were issued, the broad range of prohibited behaviour, and the fact that breach of an order is a criminal offence with potentially serious consequences. ASBOs were not seen as being in the best interests of the child (Article 3 UNCRC) and could contribute to entry into the criminal justice system. There                                                            5http://www.senedd.assemblywales.org/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=153&MId=581&Ver=4   4.2.5 Priorities for action:Welsh Government should ection for adults and children along with developing an educational and promotional strategy regarding parenting skills.   UPR Recommendation 18: To address the high incarceration rate of children, ensure that the privacy of children is protected and to put an end to the so-1    6 was concern that most ASBOs were imposed on children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Committee recommended the State Party review ASBOs with a view to abolishing their application to children. 4.3.3 The reduction in recent years of the number of children entering the youth justice system and custody (in England and Wales) may, in part, be the result of the Youth schemes.6 Wales still have one of the highest rates of child imprisonment in Western Europe  4.3.4 The UK Sta Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT) and bound by international agreement to ensure the humane treatment of children in custody. While the UK Commissioners acknowledge the commitment to this principle in all four jurisdictions, the experiences of those in custody would suggest that far more needs to be done. The have noted concern regarding documented reports detailing the negative experiences of children in custodial settings across all four jurisdictions. They are particularly concerned about the overuse and inconsistent application of physical control and restraint, strip searching and segregation, as well as limited access to an advocate. The must do everything in its power to tackle this immediately.                                                                     6 Youth Justice Board (YJB), (2011) Youth Justice Annual Workload Data 2009/10 (D126) in http://www.childcomwales.org.uk/uploads/publications/277.pdf  4.3.5 Priorities for action  The UK Government and devolved administrations must take immediate steps to re-orientate the juvenile justice system in each country in order to ensure the non-criminalisation of children and young people through a focus on prevention and diversion.  The UK Government and devolved administrations must work with relevant agencies to ensure that there is consistency and continuity of services for children and young people in the youth justice system and the wider community, especially in accessing mental health and education services.   Each Government must take immediate action to ensure that every child in custody is treated humanely and that their rights are respected.    7  4.4 Child Poverty   4.4.1 r cent of the median income after housing costs) has not fallen and in some parts the levels have increased.7The historic commitment to reduce child poverty by half by 2010 was not achieved.   4.4.2  32% of children in Wales live in households below 60 per cent of the median        income (accepted poverty threshold)   14% of children in Wales live in households below 50 percent of the median income (accepted severe poverty threshold)   Wales has the highest rates of severe child poverty in the UK  More than half of Welsh local authorities have a severe child poverty rate of 15% or higher8  4.4.3 While the UK Child Poverty Act has been a very welcome development its implementation to date has been somewhat less positive. 4.4.4 In Wales the Welsh Government introduced legislation which placed an obligation on Welsh Government and other public to produce strategies which would outline their contribution to addressing child poverty in Wales. There is also a Child Poverty Strategy for Wales in place; however, many of the levers which impact on child poverty are not within the competency of the National Assembly for Wales, for instance taxation and most aspects of welfare.  4.4.5 The UK relation to reform of the welfare system including the Welfare Reform Bill 2011. Despite benefit levels having been consistently below poverty thresholds and minimum income                                                            7 http://www.childcomwales.org.uk/uploads/publications/277.pdf  8 http://www.childcomwales.org.uk/uploads/publications/273.pdf  UPR Recommendation 11: Provide further information with regard to efforts to reduce poverty among children by half by 2010.     8 standards, benefit levels are being frozen or reduced, and additional conditionality is being introduced. A child rights impact assessment of each of these changes would demonstrate that the likeliest outcome will be increased child poverty. These changes in the Child Poverty Act 2010. 4.4.6 The UN Committee expressed concern at the ways poor children were discriminated against in terms of service provision and the fulfillment of their rights. In particular they raised concern around three areas: family support, health and education.9   4.4.7 The negative outcomes experienced by children in poverty reflect more significant problems they face, including significant challenges in accessing services.  At a time of cuts in public services, governments must prioritise provision of services to the most disadvantaged children, notably those experiencing poverty. Furthermore, close scrutiny of accessibility of services for children should be maintained to ensure barriers for children experiencing poverty are identified and overcome. There should be a particular focus on costs of accessing services, which should be waived for children in poverty.            4.5 Children seeking asylum                                                                 9 ibid 4.4.8 Priorities for action    The UK Government and devolved administrations should fully implement the Child Poverty Act 2010.   Sufficient financial resources should be allocated to tackling child poverty across the UK, funding services targeted at the most disadvantaged, and increasing the household income of poor families.  Governments must prioritise services for poor children to address the wide range of inequalities in health and educational outcomes they experience.1  UPR Recommendation 25: To withdraw its reservation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, concerning the provision that detained children be separated from adults while in detention, as well as the reservation concerning refugee and asylum seeking children. 1    9    4.5.1 Article 22 of the UNCRC states that if a child is a refugee or seeking refuge, governments must ensure that they have the same rights as any other child. Governments must help in trying to reunite child refugees with their parents. Where this is not possible, the child should be given protection.   4.5.2 There has been significant policy and legislative progress in relation to Article 22 of the UNCRC to the article was a significant and welcome step. In May 2010 the UK Government addressed one of the UNCRC children for immigration purposes. Plans for the new system were published in March it has yet to be seen whether the new process meets the requirements of the UNCRC or fulfils the recommendation of the UNCRC Committee in 2008.10  4.5.3 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, that places a duty on the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to have arrangements in place to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in discharging its functions. This legislation and accompanying guidance could have a significant impact on rea                 ENDS                                                            10 http://www.childcomwales.org.uk/uploads/publications/277.pdf  4.5.4 Priorities for action    That the UK Government, in partnership with devolved administrations, should implement and evaluate the new arrangements for family removals and safeguarding against the UNCRC and international standards.   The UK Government should undertake a thorough review of the current arrangements for determining age with a view to ensuring that unaccompanied children seeking asylum are treated as such and afforded their rights as children   Sufficient funding should be given to local government and appropriate authorities to ensure that children and young people have access to appropriate services, including guardians and independent legal advice.     10 21 November 2011 Contact: Gwion Evans, Public Affairs Officer tel: 01792 765 600/gwion.evans@childcomwales.org.uk  ",english,"submiss un human right

Tel.  022 860 2463 Email:  dubrett@talk21.com  UPR SUBMISSION -   UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN -  MAY 2012 AND NORTHERN IRELAND  1.  This submission was prepared in November 2011 on the basis of the latest information available to CPTI.    Executive summary:  2. This submission focusses on matters of military recruitment and human rights in the armed forces of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland rights concerns which it raises relate to difficulties in practice in obtaining release on grounds of conscientious objection, to continued juvenile recruitment, and occasional deployment of persons who have not reached their eighteenth birthday, to discriminatory and unfair terms of employment and to other disadvantages suffered by juvenile recruits.  Provisions for Conscientious Objectors to military service  3. At all times when the UK has imposed conscription into obligatory military service, starting in 1916, this has been accompanied by provisions for conscientious objectors.  The UK may also have been the first state to cater for the possibility that a serving member of the armed forces might develop conscientious objections, even when the original decision to enlist had been voluntary.  During the Second World War, the Appellate Tribunal for conscripts who applied for recognition as conscientious objectors was empowered to sit in an ""advisory"" capacity to hear cases where a serving member of the armed forces claimed to have developed a conscientious objection; in such cases it was referred to as the ""Advisory Tribunal"".1   4. Following the end of conscription in the early 1960's, this role of the tribunal was retained..  All service personnel, whether full-time, part-during their service, develop a genuine conscientious objection to further military                                                            1  Information supplied by Bill Hetherington of the Peace Pledge Union.  Conscience and Peace Tax International Internacional de Conciencia e Impuestos para la Paz NGO in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the UN  International non-profit organization (Belgium 15.075/96)  www.cpti.ws Bruineveld 11 · B-3010 Leuven · Belgium · Ph.: +32.16.254011 ·  e-*: cpti@cpti.ws Belgian account: 000-1709814-92  ·  IBAN: BE12 0001 7098 1492  ·  BIC: BPOTBEB1   2 2 might apply, through the command structure, for discharge on compassionate grounds.  The role of the Appellate Tribunal was taken over in 1970 by the Advisory Committee on Conscientious Objection (ACCO).  5. Constitutional Affairs.  It consists of a Chairman, a Vice Chairman and 4 lay members.  A quorum is the Chairman, Vice Chairman and 2 members.  ACCO hearings are held in public but the procedure is relatively informal.  The applicant is not informed of the Committee's decision on the day of the hearing as their advice     6. objection, the appellant is interviewed by their Commanding Officer and informed of their military service under the same conditions that applied to them before the ACCO heard their plea, until such time as they retire or are allowed to resign, if an officer, or are discharged on completion of their engagement or allowed to purchase their discharge, if a Serviceman or woman. The appellant is advised that they continue to be subject to Service discipline. However, they are not prevented from resubmitting their case, provided that there is additional and relevant evidence to be heard. In such cases   7. Within the broad framework, detailed rules are drawn up by the individual branch of the armed forces concerned, but are not made public.  The above quotations are from the rules then current in the Royal Air Force, obtained in 2007 by War Resisters' International by an application under the Freedom of Information Act.  8. Although the UK's procedures for the release of in-service conscientious objectors preceded any international obligations in this regard, such obligations are now required of it by Recommendation  CM/Rec(2010)4 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which states (paras 42  46): forces for reasons of conscience. (43.) Requests by members of the armed forces to leave the armed forces for reasons of conscience should be examined within a reasonable time. Pending the examination of their requests they should be transferred to non-combat duties, where possible. (44.) Any request to leave the armed forces for reasons of conscience should ultimately, where denied, be examined by an independent and impartial body.  (45.) Members of the armed forces having legally left the armed forces for reasons of conscience should not be subject to discrimination or to any criminal prosecution. No discrimination or prosecution should result from asking to leave the armed forces for reasons of conscience. (46.) Members of the armed forces should be informed of the rights mentioned in                                                              2  World Veterans Federation:  Evidence dated 12th August 2003, submitted to the OHCHR for Ministry of Defence document.   3 9. As noted above, the documents outlining the procedures to be followed have not been made public.  In practice information about the possibility of release on such grounds is not readily available to those who might be affected.  10. Until such time as rejected and made the subject of an appeal to ACCO, applications for release on the grounds of conscientious objection are handled neither independently or publicly.  Any release of a conscientious objector by the individual services is officially recorded simply within the figures giving the number of releases on compassionate grounds.  .  11. In response to a Freedom of Information request in January 2011, the Ministry of Defence produced figures showing that during the years 2000 to 2010  a total of six persons had been  the armed forces because of moral, 3   Of nine applications received, five (two succesful) had been from the Royal Navy and four (all succesful) from the Royal Air Force.  A separate Freedom of Information request had revealed that in the previous decade there had been thirteen applications from the Royal Navy and one from the Army, but did not indicate the outcome.  In the more recent figures, no cases were reported from the Army, by far the largest branch of the armed forces in number of personnel.  We gather however that during this decade at least one potential conscientious objector from the Army was offered honourable release before submitting an application, and on condition of confidentiality.  By definition, it is impossible to know how many cases may have been similarly resolved, or how many would-be conscientous objectors are dissuaded from ever registering a formal application for release. Even these very limited statistics reported above hint at a hardening of approach, with the six successful applications recorded as having been made in the period 2003  2006, while three unsuccesful applications were lodged in the years 2006 to 2010.     12. From its foundation in 1970 until 1996 ACCO,  handled only 36 appeals, 11 of which it upheld.4      It was convened for the first time since 1996 on 17th December 2010, to adjudicate in the case of  LMA (Leading Medical Assistant) Michael Lyons, whose application for release from the Royal Navy had been rejected that September .    13. In the Lyons case, the procedures followed deviated in some respects from those outlined in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.    The Chairman of the Committee chose to announce at the end of the hearing that the Committee would recommend rejection of the appeal.  This was erroneously described as upholding the decision of Lyons' commanding officer, although it had emerged in the hearing that the commanding officer had initially supported the application and that it was the naval chaplain who had subsequently interviewed Lyons who had first expressed the view that his objections were not of conscience but simply represented his political views about the Aghanistan conflict.   There is no evidence that the acceptance of the recommendation by the Secretary of State was ever formally recorded or formally communicated to Lyons in the prescribed manner.                                                               3  The Independent, 30th January 2011. 4   Stolwijk, M., The Right to Conscientious Objection in Europe, Quaker Council on European Affairs, Brussels, 2005, also at www.wri-irg.org/co/rtba/unitedkingdom.htm   4 14. Despite the irregularities, Lyons chose not to incur the potential expense of a judicial review of  the ACCO decision.  However the facts of the case  (a member of medical personnel whose entire previous service was in submarines who, discovering that on active deployment in a land campaign he would be required in all circumstances to give priority to military rather than civilian casualties, which was contrary to his understanding of medical ethics, and who was also taken aback to learn that he would be required to bear a firearm -combatant status, he might in practice be required to take an active part in hostilities)  do raise the question of whether in the current situation of engagement in an increasingly unpopular war any application for release on grounds of conscientious objection under the current procedures will be treated on its individual merits rather    15. A further weakness, as noted in CPTI's submission to the Human Rights Committee prior to the consideration in 2008 of the UK's Sixth Periodic Report under suspensory effect.  There is no protection whatsoever against the possibility that the conscientious objector may, after lodging the application, be given a specific order realised in the Lyons case.   16. While Lyons' application to ACCO was pending, he was detailed for an advanced firearms course in anticipation of a posting to Afghanistan.  Citing his pending application, he asked to be excused participation.  The officer in charge consulted the command structure, and after several hours deliberation the decision was made that Lyons should be ordered to collect a weapon and proceed to the range; in the express anticipation that the order would be refused and he could then be charged with wilful disobedience.   The ensuing Court Martial took place on 5th July 2011, seven months after the ACCO hearing.    Lyons was reduced to the ranks, and dismissed the service, but first sentenced to seven months detention in a military correction facility.  An appeal to the civilian courts was heard on 13th October 2011, but both conviction and sentence were upheld, the Court having been obliged to not a conscientious objector.  At the time of writing, in November 2011, the publication of the full reasoning of the appeal court is still awaited with interest.  17. CPTI recommends that the UK enshrine the procedures for release from the armed forces on grounds of conscientious objection in legislation, that details are included in the information made available to all recruits at the time of first enlistment, and that all duties involving the bearing of firearms be suspended as soon as reasonably possible after registration of an application.  Juvenile recruitment and deployment  18.. In the working group on the first cycle of the UPR, the Russian Federation o consider removal of its reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in   5 armed conflict.5   The UK declaration made upon signature of the Optional Protocol is an interpretive statement rather than a reservation. In it the UK made clear that the British Armed Forces would continue to recruit from age 16 but included a clear commitment to take all feasible measures to ensure those who had not yet reached the age of 18 did not take a   19.  ocol would not exclude the deployment of members of its armed forces under the age of 18 to take a direct part in hostilities where: - a) there is a genuine military need to deploy their unit or ship to an area in which hostilities are taking place; and b) by reason of the nature and urgency of the situation:-i) it is not practicable to withdraw such persons before deployment; or ii) to do so would undermine the operational effectiveness of their ship or unit, and thereby put at risk the successful completion of the military mission   20. In its concluding observations on the UK's Initial Report under the Optional Protocol in September 2008, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, recommended that the State party review this interpretative declaration to ensure that its policy and practice are in conformity with article 1 of the Protocol and that children are not 6  21. The Committee  had welcomed assurances that no person under 18 had been deployed since July 2005.  Prior to that date, according to the Child Soldiers Global Report 2008  no fewer than 18 persons under the age of 18 had been deployed since the signing of the Optional Protocol.   However, in answer to a Parliamentary Question on 18th. October 2011, a spokesman for the Secretary of State for Defence of 18 years and deployed to operational theatres between April 2008 and March 7    Unfair terms of service and other disadvantages suffered by young recruits  22. Juvenile recruits into the Army are contractually committed to serving until  the age of 22, irrespective of when they actually joined.  Thus the younger a recruit is at the time of enlistment  with parental consent, the longer the initial period of service, which thus may reach six years, with no legal right to obtain an earlier discharge once an initial six months reconsideration period has elapsed.  As long ago as 1991, the Parliamentary Select Committee for the Armed Forces Bill suggested that juvenile recruits should have an opportunity to reconsider at the point when they reached the age of 18, but with respect to the Army no action on this proposal has yet been taken.8                                                             5  10th April 2008, reported in A/HRC/8/25, para 56.26. 6     CRC/C/OPAC/GBR/CO1, 17th October 2008, para 11. 7   Hansard   18 Oct 2011 : Column 868W  8   Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers:  Catch 16  22:  Recruitment and retention of minors in the British Armed Forces, London, 2011, p.5   6 23. As the report quoted in the previous paragraph also shows in detail, juvenile recruits  are at particular risk of bullying, self-harm and suicide.  They are also disproportionately likely to drop out of the  armed forces, and those who have done so are heavily  represented in the nation's prison and homeless populations.

12,CRAE - Childrens Rights Alliance for England," 1 of 15    UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW  UK  (2012 examination)  State of Children's Rights in England   PREPARATION OF THIS REPORT  1. The Children's Rights Alliance for England (CRAE) is one of the largest NGO children's rights alliances in the world. Established in 1992, we protect the human rights of children by lobbying government and others who hold power, by bringing or supporting test cases and by using national and international human rights mechanisms. We provide free legal information and advice, raise awareyear we publish a review of the st  2. This report is based on our ongoing monitoring of children's rights, following the comprehensive submission we made to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child for its autumn 2008 examination of the UK. During that process, CRAE made 152 recommendations for ensuring the effective implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in England; over 100 NGOs working with and for children in England endorsed these recommendations.   3. Further evidence was obtained from our annual children's rights symposiums in 2010 and 2011, the latest of which (July 2011) was attended by 60+ member organisations. In December 2011, CRAE will publish its detailed State of Children's Rights in England report on Government action across the past 12 months on the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's latest concluding observations on the UK.  POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS  Statutory measures to end child poverty and socio-economic inequalities 4. The Child Poverty Act 2010 places a statutory duty on the Secretary of State to meet child poverty targets and to introduce a UK child poverty strategy, giving particular consideration to groups of children who disproportionately experience socio-economic disadvantage. The Act was widely supported by NGOs working with and for children (though its implementation is deeply disappointing  see below).     2 of 15  Political recognition of the harm caused by immigration detention  5. The coalition Government made an historic pledge in May 2010 to end the detention of children for immigration purposes; and there has been a significant reduction in this harmful practice. Child detention continues, nevertheless, and there has been no change in the law relating to when, and for how long, children may be detained. Between October 2010 and August 2011 (latest published figures), 56 children entered detention for immigration purposes.1   promote and protect their rights 6. The coalition Government established an independent review of the Office of the Children's Commissioner for England; accepted in principle all of its recommendations; and recently completed a public consultation on the role, independence and powers of the Children's Commissioner. The promise of a Children's Commissioner empowered by law to promote and protect children's is strongly supported across the NGO community.  Safeguards for children in armed forces  7. Following revelations that children had been imprisoned for attempting to leave the armed forces without authorisation (going absent without leave) in June 2011 the Ministry of Defence introduced new regulations granting children in the armed forces the right to be discharged up until their eighteenth birthday (though with a three-month waiting period).2   8. The Government promised in May 2011 to amend regulations that require children -3 This will be a positive development when implemented though the UK has the lowest recruitment age in Europe and is the only permanent member of the UN Security Council to recruit 16 year-olds.4   Promise of reform of child protection system 9. The coalition Government established an independent review of the child protection system; and has accepted the overarching recommendation that procedures and practices must place the child at the centre and protect their rights. It is with regret, however, that this review focused on child protection in the community and excluded custody and immigration detention.   Strengthening of child's right to be heard  10. Since the last UPR, there have been a number of positive developments in relation to implementing the child's right to be heard and taken seriously (Article 12, CRC). This includes a new duty on schools to invite and consider children's views (though this has not yet come into force); the strengthening of the independent reviewing officer role for children in care (with a new duty to ensure the child's wishes and feelings are considered); duties on central and local government to consult children in the   3 of 15 development of child poverty strategies; and the piloting of an independent right of appeal for children regarding Special Educational Needs decisions with a view to extending this to all children.  AREAS OF CONSIDERABLE CONCERN   11. There has been no progress on the development of a Bill of Rights or the incorporation of the principles and provisions of the CRC into domestic law.   12. In December 2010, the coalition Government promised to give due consideration to the CRC when developing new law and policy. Yet CRAE's analysis of legislation and policy developed since this pledge shows virtually no progress.5  13. Children enjoy some human rights protection in domestic law through the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA). However, this Act only protects the rights in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and then not all of them. The duty in Section 6 of the HRA  that public authorities act compatibly with the ECHR  provides an excellent model for a children's rights public sector duty, which would begin to see the CRC mainstreamed in public services and policy decision-making (as a stepping stone towards full incorporation). Whilst HRA protection is vital, and has made a considerable impact, the civil and political rights in the ECHR were not designed with children in mind and offer much less protection than those in the CRC. For disabled children, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which the UK ratified in July 2009, elaborates even further on civil and political rights. Furthermore, the reluctance of successive UK Governments to enshrine economic and social rights leaves many vulnerable children unprotected  in a still very wealthy country.   14. Political and media attacks on the HRA make many in the human rights community extremely fearful of retrenchment and forces us into defending the status quo, when children (and others) desperately need far greater rights protection.   15. It is deeply regrettable that the UK has to date only signed up to two international complaints mechanisms (for the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities).   Socio-economic inequality  16. In 1991, the year the UK ratified the CRC, 31% of British children lived in poverty (below 60% of median income after housing costs). By 2009/10 this had reduced by just two percentage points to 29% of UK children. This is a fall from 4.1 million children living in poverty to 3.8 million.6   17. More than 1 in 10 children in England (13%) live in severe poverty, with this figure increasing to as high as 27% in some northern cities and areas of London.7      4 of 15 18. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) assessed Government spending decisions in 2010 and concluded they were disproportionately harming children and families. Its preliminary analysis of the new Universal Credit notes that families with children will be among the winners but lone parents will lose out once transitional protection ends.8   19. The Universal Credit will merge all state benefits and tax credits into a single scheme. IFS has recently assessed that 450,000 more children will be taken out of poverty between 2015 and 2020 as a consequence of the Universal Credit but that the coalition Government's policies will  of meeting statutory child poverty targets, with the likelihood of relative child poverty in 2020 being at its highest rate since 1999 and absolute child poverty the highest since 2001.9   20. The UK is characterised by enormous socio-economic inequalities  a fact consistently confirmed by Government and NGO research, reviews and policy papers. However, there is a growing reluctance from policy makers to recognise their obligations under international human rights law to end these inequalities. The prevailing ideology is to demean, blame and punish the victims of economic and social rights violations. Children North East, the longest established independent children's charity in the North East of England, reports that many families reliant on welfare benefits have had all support withdrawn whilst under investigation for fraud  a presumption of guilt rather than innocence.  21. Remarkably, the UK Government's first ever child poverty strategy, published in April 2011, included housing benefit cuts and reductions in support for sick and disabled people. Office for National Statistics figures show that in 2009 infants from the poorest households in England and Wales were almost twice as likely to die in their first year than infants with parents in higher managerial and professional occupations. There is nearly 16 years difference in life expectancy for babies born into the poorest and richest areas of the UK.10 83 children aged 14 years or under were admitted to hospital with malnutrition in England in the past three years.11  Access to justice under grave threat 22. The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, presently going through Parliament, threatens to remove civil legal aid from 75,000 children and young people each year. This includes more than 25,000 social welfare cases relating to housing, debt, employment and welfare benefits.   23. When legislation establishing an entitlement to legal aid was first introduced into Parliament, in December 1948, the then Attorney General explained:   I should be inclined to call this Bill a charter. It is the charter of the little man to the British courts of justice. It is a Bill which will open the doors of the courts freely to all persons who may wish to avail themselves of British justice without regard to the question of their wealth or ability to pay.12    5 of 15 Protection from age discrimination only applied to adults 24. The Equality Act 2010 provides protection from age discrimination in services, public functions and associations (coming into force in April 2012). But this protection is itself discriminatory as it only applies to people over the age of 18 years. Despite strong lobbying by CRAE and others, and the recommendations of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, former Ministers persisted with excluding children from protection from age discrimination. The latest policy document states:  [Protection from age discrimination] does not apply to the under-age is closely related to his or her levels of development and need. Therefore, the basic principle of age discrimination legislation  that people should be treated the same regardless of their age  is rarely appropriate to the treatment of children. A three-year-old would usually need to be treated differently from a teenager, for example.13  25. It then outlines the many exceptions that will be introduced to cater for the vast diversity of need within the adult population, because:  We do not want the law to interfere unnecessarily where age is used in a valid way to help target or provide services, but need to ensure that age discrimination [against adults] is taken as seriously as other types of discrimination.14  Discrimination faced by Gypsy, Roma and Traveller children 26. The Government acknowledges that disadvantages of all ethnic minority groups with a much shorter life expectancy, low income and poor access to finance. Their children have high mortality rates and the .15 Yet Ministers are making it even harder for Gypsy, Roma and Traveller families to access sites with adequate amenities and safe play areas for children. They have failed to protect Traveller education services from local authority cuts (made as a consequence of reduced funding from central Government). Nearly half of local authorities in England and Wales have either abolished their Traveller education service or made major cuts, despite a Government report in 2010 concluding  opportunities for Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils. Without a framework of targeted support at both local and national levels, the improvement of outcomes for these pupils 16  27. The coalition Government made available considerable funds17 to forcibly evict 86 Traveller and Gypsy families from land they own at Dale Farm in Basildon, Essex.  28. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination urged the UK authorities to delay the eviction, to no avail.18 Riot police were tasked with forcing the families from their land and heavy machinery used to destroy homes and possessions. The removal began at 7am on 19 October 2011 with the disconnection of all electricity supplies. Up to 150 children lived on the land.    6 of 15 29. In the 1970s, the local authority gave planning permission to 40 English Romany families to live next to a scrapyard (an area called Oak Lane). In 1996, the scrapyard owner sold the adjoining land, Dale Farm, to an Irish Traveller family. Over the years more families joined, leading to the two sites at one stage being the largest Traveller community in the UK. The families were repeatedly refused planning permission and the local authority commenced legal proceedings in 2001. Local authorities have not been under any duty to provide Traveller sites since the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 repealed Part II of the Caravan Sites Act 1968.    Rights of disabled children  30. Disabled children are affected by all of the rights issues raised in this submission. In addition, their right to family life is compromised by out of area residential placements, which make continuing links with family and community extremely difficult. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended in 2008 that the UK Government review why so many disabled children live in institutional care: this has not been done.  31. There has been no progress in removing the reservation to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in relation to inclusive education (Article 24). The UK Government claims in its draft submission to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities that Discrimination against disabled people in education is prohibited in Great Britain by the Equality Act 2010yet legislation still allows schools to refuse admission to a disabled child who has a statement of special educational needs if the child's attendance at the school would be incompatible with the provision of efficient education for other children or the wishes of parents.19   32. There is insufficient action to ensure that the right to be heard and taken seriously in Article 12 of the CRC is applied to disabled children. Research conducted by KIDS, an NGO working with disabled children, young people and families, found that disabled children's access to outdoor play spaces is very limited (over half of parents / carers said their child visits a play space just once a month or less). Parents cited a number of barriers impeding children's right to play: spaces, play equipment, transport and parking, toilets and information about appropriate .20  33. Furthermore, there is a disproportionate harmful effect of welfare reforms on disabled children, including reductions under the Universal Credit. The Children's Society reports that the introduction of the Universal Credit could leave families with a young carer nearly £3,000 short a year. Currently, disabled adults are entitled to a £70 a week Severe Disability Premium  claimable if they have no-one to care for them or receive assistance from a young carer.21  Violence against children 34. Five years after the publication of the UN Secretary-General's Study on Violence Against Children, the UK has still not published (or even promised) a national strategy to end all violence against children.    7 of 15  35. There were 722 child homicides in the past 10 years (75% of children knew the suspect).22  36. 31 children have died in custody since 1990, two following restraint-related incidents. Yet there has not been a single public inquiry into the treatment of children in custody.  37. Tasers were used on children aged between 13 and 17 years 252 times by police forces in England between July 2007 and December 2009 (latest available statistics).23 In November 2006, the Home Office Scientific Development Branch reported a safety notice issued by the manufacturer Tasertron (now Taser Technologies Inc.) warning against the use of Tasers on children. Amnesty International reviewed 334 deaths following Taser use by law enforcement officers in the US (including the deaths of three children). It examined available research literature which pointed to the enormous risks of Taser use on children and other people of small stature.24   38. loco parentis, meaning that parents and carers are permitted to lawfully assault a child. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children conducted research in 2009 on child abuse and neglect and found that 42% of parents or carers had physically -old; and 46% a child aged between 11 and 17 years).25   Further erosion of civil rights in schools 39. School and college staff powers to search children without their consent have been extended despite no evidence of their necessity. Staff are already able to search students for weapons,26 alcohol, drugs, and stolen property.27 The Education Act 2011 extends the items for which staff can search children to include any article that staff reasonably suspect has been (or is likely to be) used to commit an offence or to cause ops and other devices and delete information .28   40. As well as extending the search powers themselves, the Education Act 2011 removes a number of significant safeguards for children who are being searched. It removes requirements for the search to be carried out by a member of staff of the same sex as the child, and to be witnessed by another member of staff, if they reasonably believe that there is a risk that serious harm will be caused if the search is not conducted. There is no requirement to record when a child is searched.  41. The coalition Government has decided to repeal the duty on schools to record significant incidents where force is used on a child and to report these incidents to parents,29 with potentially serious consequences for very young children and some disabled children (including those in residential schools) unable to communicate concerns to parents and   8 of 15 carers. The decision follows two Government reviews of the duty carried out in the past year. The first concluded in January 2011 that implementing the duty .30 The second concluded that the duty and that .31 Duties to record use of force are already in place in other settings including ions, immigration detention centres, and by police and mental health workers.32  42. There is still no legal provision for children's views to be heard in exclusion proceedings and only parents have the right in domestic law to appeal exclusion from school. Furthermore, the removal of exclusion appeal panels' power to reinstate excluded students, contained in the Education Act 2011, removes any chance of a child's perspective having any weight in challenging exclusion  making domestic law even more incompatible with Article 12 of the CRC. In addition, parents retain the legal power to remove students from sex and relationships education that is not part of the science national curriculum. Only sixth-formers have the legal right to opt out of collective worship (since February 2009; only extended to sixth-in September 2011).  43.  separated children Guardianship has still not been established for separated children, despite the recommendation of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2002. ECPAT UK explains that this failure has 33 A report published by UNICEF UK in 2010 on the experiences of separated migrant children in three English local authority areas highlights how vital social work and other support is to separated children:  There was overwhelming evidence to suggest that one of the most significant factors determining unaccompanied or separated migraand support is the presence of supportive, reliable and consistent adult support in their lives.34  44. But this crucial support was not always there for children:  o play this role was severely limited and meant that they were doing little more than trouble shooting and sign-posting. Many unaccompanied or separated migrant children and young people were lonely and isolated and missed the kind of support provided by a family.35  45.  juvenile justice There has been very little progress in juvenile justice policy to address the issues raised in the 2008 UPR and other subsequent treaty monitoring processes.    9 of 15 46. While there has been a welcome drop in the numbers of children incarcerated, the UK has the 7th highest proportion of child prisoners among all OECD member countries.36 There is no statutory safeguard ensuring that custody is used only as a last resort and for the shortest period of time  recommended by both the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights in 2008.   47. The authorities' responses to this summer's public disorder at best contributed to a misperception that the majority of offenders were young people. The UK's juvenile justice obligations, particularly in relation to protecting the child's right to privacy and ensuring contact with the criminal justice system is a last resort, did not feature in Ministerial interventions.  48. In September 2011, the Ministry of Justice issued a statistical bulletin on the August disturbances. This showed that, as of 12 September:  a. 21% (364) of those brought before the courts were children b. 45.2% of these children had no previous offences c. Of 26 children sentenced to immediate custody, only one was convicted of a violent disorder offence.37  49. The recent drop in custodial numbers has led to welcome de-commissioning of custodial places, but this has been disproportionately in the secuthan in prison accommodation).38 The closure of some units means that children may be placed further away from their home area and there are fewer options for the most vulnerable; for example, there is now no secure childr  50. The coalition Government has established a Restraint Management Board and a young offender institutions and secure training centres. The new system is not yet in the public domain but it is likely that it will continue to allow the deliberate infliction of severe pain as part of restraint techniques  contrary to the criticisms and recommendations of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (2006)39, the UN Human Rights Council (2008), the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (2008)40, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (2009)41, the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights (2008)42 and the UK's four Children's Commissioners (2008).43 In October 2008, Thomas Hammarberg, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, observed:  The Commissioner has been struck by the apparent focus in UK custodial settings on  He is not aware of any other member state that sanctions the use of deliberate pain as a method of restraining a child [our emphasis].44  51. Government officials within the Department of Health have stated:    10 of 15 children and young people displaying challenging and difficult behaviour can be successfully managed without the use of restraints or methods involving pain compliance, which would be in line with the management of aggression and violence across healthcare settings.45  52. Statistics published by the Youth Justice Board (YJB) and the Ministry of Justice in January 2011 show:  a. There were 6,904 incidents of restraint in child custody in 2009/10 b. 257 (4%) incidents resulted in recorded injuries on children  c. On average, 11% of children in custody are restrained at least once whilst incarcerated d. For every 100 girls entering custody, 42 are subject to restraint e. For every 100 boys entering custody, 15 are subject to restraint f. The YJB reports no difference in the use of restraint according to children's ethnicity g. No data appears to be collected on the use of restraint on disabled children in custody h. No data appears to be collected on the use of restraint on pregnant girls in custody.46  53. In March 2011, the Office of the Children's Commissioner released a report of 89 children's views and experiences of restraint in child custody. Children's testimonies are deeply disturbing and possibly indicative of widespread unlawful practice across all forms of custody:  a. Reports of staff using gratuitous physical and verbal violence during and after restraint  ; ned on my first day here [in a secure children's home] and had cuts on my hand from it and they left  b. A report of a child bein c. Reports of staff not reducing the use of force as a child calms down / when they have control of the situation  control because obviously it's putt d. Reports of staff not reducing the use of force when a child is complaining of excessive pain  ch pain, and they said   11 of 15 someone getting bent up and they were saying I'm not resisting, I'm not resisting  e. Reports of disproportionate numbers of staff restraining an individual child  Twenty men to restrain a five foot womanneed two, because six, that's just way over t f. A report of staff jumping on children during restraint g. A report of children being stood on and scratched during restraint.  54. Children reported feeling embarrassed, powerless, angry and panic-stricken when being restrained. Whilst some of the 89 children recalled restraint being used in an appropriate way and for justifiable reasons, none described staff and managers promoting a positive, non-violent culture.47   55. Recent criminal justice law and policy makes little or no distinction between adults and children  for example, the use of gang injunctions and mandatory custodial sentences for 16 and 17 year-olds convicted of carrying a knife.  56. The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill proposes that the status of children who are refused bail and remanded will be that of a looked after child. This is a very welcome development. However, many organisations, including the National Association of Youth Justice, wish to see this protected status extended to all children who are sentenced to custody, consistent with Article 20 of the CRC.  57. There have been no changes to anti social behaviour legislation although the coalition Government has indicated that it may publish a Green Paper in 2012. It was deeply disappointing tha-social behaviour proposed to treat adults and children in much the same way; and retained custodial punishments for civil offences. Local authorities and criminal justice agencies have applied anti-social behaviour sanctions to the young in a grossly disproportionate way. When anti-social behaviour orders were first introduced, Government guidance stated they would 48, yet 10 to 17 year-olds account for 40% of orders and only 10% of the population.49   RECOMMENDATIONS  58. The UK should fully incorporate the principles and provisions of the CRC into domestic law.  59. The UK should accept the right of individual petition within: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Optional Protocol; the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Article 14); and the Convention Against Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Article 22).    12 of 15 60. There should be one government department in charge of all policy affecting children, working consistently and explicitly within the framework of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  61. Substantial additional resources must be invested towards the realisation of children's rights, with a particular focus on eradicating child poverty and tackling inequality. Expenditure on children must be separated out and shown discretely and collected systematically.   62. The Convention on the Rights of the Child should be included in the statutory national curriculum.   63. The former duty on local authorities to provide Traveller sites must be reinstated.   64. The provision in Section 316 of the Education Act 1996 (as amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001) that permits the refusal of a child with a statement of special educational needs to attend a mainstream school because of the efficient education of other children should be removed from law.   65. The UK Government should develop a national strategy to end all forms of violence against children.   66. The use of Taser guns on, or in the vicinity of, children should be prohibited in law.   67. As a matter of urgency, an independent review should be undertaken of disabled tion in the community, to examine why so many disabled children are in long term institutional care and to review the care and treatment of children in these settings.   68. Reporting restrictions relating to antisocial behaviour and civil and criminal (breach) proceedings involving children, should be reinstated as a matter of urgency.  69. completely to ensure children equal protection under the criminal law on assault and build the promotion of positive, non-violent relationships with children into all parenting education and support programmes and the training of all those who work with children and families.   70. The UK Government should ensure that all health and social care frontline staff are trained in human rights principles and it should introduce a statutory duty to raise awareness of children's rights on all public authorities working with children or parents. Funding should be available to schools and other children's services to meet this new duty.    13 of 15 71. Schools should be required by law to record all significant incidents of use of force; and to report these to parents and carers.  72. The right to be heard and taken seriously should be systematically implemented in the education system  for all children.  73. The UK Government should establish an independent statutory guardianship system for all separated children.  74. Separated children should be taken into care. A local authority should have parental responsibility for the child under Section 20 or 31 of the Children Act 1989. They should be entitled to all the same care and support as other looked after children (not simply provided with accommodation). Policy responsibility for these children should move to the Department for Education.  75. The policy of detaining families with children under Immigration Act powers should be stopped immediately. The separation of young children from their primary caregiver during the immigration process should be prohibited in law unless this is not in the best interests of the child. Alternatives to detention must comply with all aspects of the Convention.  76. The UK Government should commit itself to a distinct juvenile justice system, based on must have no place in the juvenile justice system; proposals to include punishment as one of the statutory purposes of sentencing should be scrapped.   77. The age of criminal responsibility in England should be amended to reflect the requirement of international human rights standards for a completely distinct approach to dealing with all juvenile crime.  78. Children should not be tried as adults in crown courts (though the right to a jury trial should be retained).  79. A distinct children's custody threshold should be introduced in law to ensure that only children who have caused (or could reasonably be expected to have caused) serious physical or psychological harm and who are a serious danger to others can be held in custody; and then for only the shortest period of time.   80. Children should only ever be detained in child-centred environments which have a single joint aim: to provide positive rehabilitation and to meet the child's needs. These environments must operate to the highest child care and human rights standards, be non-punitive and demonstrably distinct in culture and practice from prison establishments. Children in custody should have a statutory right to independent advocacy. To ensure equitable care and protection with other vulnerable children, both in a   14 of 15  81. Restraint techniques in child custodial settings that deliberately aim to cause pain should be prohibited in law.

Child Soldiers International is an international human rights research and advocacy organization which campaigns for the effective implementation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, a global ban on any form of military recruitment of boys and girls below the age of 18, and a definitive end to the military use of children in any capacity.  The organization was previously known as the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers. 2. In this submission, Child Soldiers International provides information relating to the recruitment and use of children by the British armed forces.  In section 1, Child Soldiers International raises issues concerning national legislation, adherence to international human rights standards and implementation of the recommendations of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review. In section 2, we describe implementation of human rights obligations and commitments, including the Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. 3. Recommendations are included in relation to each area of concern.

Child Soldiers International United Kingdom: Submission to the Universal Periodic Review  Second Cycle, 13th Session 2012  2  Section 1:  BACKGROUND AND FRAMEWORK A. Scope of international obligations  4. The United Kingdom ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OPAC) in 2003.  Upon signature (and confirmed upon ratification), the United Kingdom made a declaration detailing circumstances in which it would continue to deploy soldiers aged below 18 years to take direct part in hostilities.  This declaration has the effect of a reservation, contrary to the object and purpose of OPAC, which prioritises perceived military necessity over the rights and welfare of the child.  The declaration does not specify any minimum age below which no soldier would be deployed. 5. The United Kingdom accepted the recommendation of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review ntion on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed declaration upon signature of OPAC was an 1  As the declaration limits the legal effect of article 2 of OPAC, it amounts in effect to a reservation.2 The reservation / declaration has not been reviewed or removed following acceptance of this recommendation. 6. The Committee on the Rights of the Child and the United Kingddeclaration on OPAC be reviewed.3  These recommendations have not been implemented.    B. Constitutional and legislative framework Recruitment age 7. The Armed Forces (Enlistment) Regulations 2009 establish the minimum recruitment age as 16 years.  This is the lowest age permitted under OPAC and is contrary to other national legislation which prohibits persons aged below 18 years from signing legal contracts.  The United Kingdom has not reviewed the minimum recruitment age since ratifying OPAC in 2003.  The United Kingdom has the lowest recruitment age in Europe and is the only permanent member of the UN Security Council to recruit 16 year-olds.   8. Commenting on the U                                                           1 See: Human Rights Council, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review - United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: Addendum, Views on the conclusions and/or recommendations, voluntary commitments and replies presented by the State under review, A/HRC/8/25/Add.1, 25 August 2008, para.6. 2 See: however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State. 3 See:  Committee on the Rights of the Child, Concluding Observations on the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 17 October 2008, CRC/C/OPAC/GBR/CO/1, para.11; House of Commons/ House of Lords Joint Committee on Human Rights,  2009, para.143.  Child Soldiers International United Kingdom: Submission to the Universal Periodic Review  Second Cycle, 13th Session 2012  3  human rights institution) encouraged the United Kingdom to cease recruiting children into the armed forces.4  9. The Committee on the Rights of the Child, the  Joint Committee on Human Rights, and the  Defence Select Committee have all recommended that the minimum recruitment age be reconsidered with a view to raising it to 18 years, but these recommendations have not been implemented.5   Discriminatory terms of employment 10. Under the Army Terms of Service (Amendment etc.) Regulations 2008 child recruits entering the Army are legally committed to serve until they are at least 22 years old. This means that recruits enlisting aged 16 or 17 must serve a minimum of six or five years respectively. In contrast, recruits enlisting aged 18 or above only serve for a minimum of four years. Consequently, a 16-year-old recruit is bound by a minimum service period 50 per cent longer than an adult recruit. Similar discrepancies in minimum terms of service for child recruits in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy were eliminated in 2001.   11. This disparity in Army terms of employment does not appear to be compliant with national legislation in the form of Article 39 of the Equality Act 2010, which prohibits discrimination (including on the grounds of age) in terms and conditions of employment.  C. Policy measures  12. The Ministry of Defence has issued administrative guidelines relating to deployment of soldiers aged below 18 years.  These guidelines contain the same exceptions found in the declaration upon signature of OPAC (above) and therefore do not constitute an absolute prohibition on the deployment of children into hostilities.  The guidelines effectively reassert the United KingdomOPAC.  Recommendations:  The United Kingdom should immediately withdraw its declaration to OPAC and amend armed forces guidelines to implement an absolute prohibition on the deployment of children into hostilities, in all circumstances.  The United Kingdom should immediately raise the armed forces minimum recruitment age to 18 years.  The United Kingdom should immediately amend the Army Terms of Service (Amendment etc) Regulations 2008 to end unfavourable age discrimination in minimum service periods for child recruits.                                                            4 See: Equality and Human Rights Commission, UK Government UPR Mid-term Report: Report from the Equality and Human Rights Commission. 5 See: Committee on the Rights of the Child, Concluding Observations on the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 17 October 2008, CRC/C/OPAC/GBR/CO/1, para.13; House of Commons/ House of Lords Joint Committee on Human Rights,  2009, para.143; House of Commons Defence Committee, Duty of Care, 2005, para.14.   Child Soldiers International United Kingdom: Submission to the Universal Periodic Review  Second Cycle, 13th Session 2012  4  Section 2:  PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ON THE GROUND A. Implementation of international human rights obligations Increased child recruitment 13. Since 2008 the United Kingdom has continued to recruit children into its armed forces in large numbers. Recruitment intake % of total recruitment intake aged 16 % of total recruitment intake aged 17 % of total recruitment intake aged below 18 Number of recruits aged 16 Number of recruits aged 17 Total number of recruits aged below 18  Year       All armed forces 2008/09 11 14.4 25.4 2,495 3,285 5,780 2009/10 9.2 12.2 21.4 2,010 2,665 4,675 2010/11 12.8 11.3  24.1 1,460 1,300 2,760         Army 2008/09 13.6 14.9 28.5 1,980 2,155 4,135 2009/10 12.7 12.9 25.6 1,795 1,835 3,630 2010/11 17.4 12.4 29.8 1,400 1,000 2,400         Navy / Marines 2008/09 7.8 13.8 21.6 315 550 865 2009/10 3.7 10.5 14.2 155 435 590 2010/11 2.4 9.9 12.3 60 220 280         Air Force 2008/09 4.7 13.6 18.3 200 580 780 2009/10 1.7 11.4 13.1 60 395 455 2010/11 1.1 6.6 7.7 10 80 90 (Source: www.dasa.mod.uk)  14. In 2010/11 the number of children recruited into the armed forces (as a percentage of overall recruitment intake) rose significantly for the first time on record.  This was a dramatic reverse to the steady downward trend in child recruitment evident over the previous decade.  The increase resulted from a four percent rise in the recruitment of 16 year-olds which meant that for the first time the United Kingdom recruited more 16 year-olds than 17 year-olds.  This was in direct contravention of the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child that the United Kingdom should reconsider its policy of actively recruiting children, raise its minimum recruitment age to 18 years and, for as long as it continued to recruit children, prioritise recruitment of the oldest among child recruits.6                                                             6 See: Committee on the Rights of the Child, Concluding Observations on the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 17 October 2008, CRC/C/OPAC/GBR/CO/1, paras.13 and 15.   Child Soldiers International United Kingdom: Submission to the Universal Periodic Review  Second Cycle, 13th Session 2012  5  15. Deliberate, increased targeting of children for recruitment into the armed forces is contrary to the spirit and intention of OPAC, to the explicit recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child,7 and is in marked contrast to the positive international trend towards prohibiting all forms of child recruitment (more than 130 states now have an armed forces minimum recruitment age of 18 or above). Deployment of children into hostilities 16. As a consequence of its high levels of child recruitment and failure to implement a total prohibition on deployment of soldiers aged below 18 years the United Kingdom has repeatedly exposed to children to the risk of participation in hostilities.  Between 2003 and 2005 fifteen soldiers aged below 18 years were deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.  Five more underage soldiers were deployed between 2007 and 2010.8 Recommendations:  The United Kingdom should immediately end its practice of actively targeting children for recruitment into the armed forces.  The United Kingdom should raise the minimum age for recruitment into the armed forces to 18 years.  The United Kingdom should implement and enforce an absolute prohibition on the deployment of children into hostilities, in all circumstances.                                                            7 See: Committee on the Rights of the Child, Concluding Observations on the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 9 October 2002, CRC/C/15/Add.188, parahile it recruits persons who have attained the age of 16 years but who have not attained the age of 18 years, endeavour to give priority to those who are the oldest in light of article 38, para. 3 of the Convention and strengthen and increase its efforts to recruit persons of 18 years and  8 See: Hansard, HC Deb: 1 February 2007, c508w; House of Lords / House of Commons Joint Committee on Human Rights, Legislative Scrutiny: Armed Forces Bill Session 201011, May 2011.

14,CSW - Christian Solidarity Worldwide ,"November 2011 UPR  13th Session  UK CSW  Stakeholder Submission Page 1 of 5   Universal Periodic Review  13th Session CSW  Stakeholder Submission UNITED KINGDOM   Introduction  1. Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW), a human rights organisation specialising in freedom of religion or belief, wishes to draw attention to the United Ki2007-2011 with respect to its international obligations and treatment of asylum seekers.  2. The UK has ratified relevant international treaties that ensure freedom of religion or belief (FORB), however the manner in which policy is applied in asylum cases is highly politicised and enshrines a negative bias against applicants, thereby rendering domestic law compliant with the letter of international obligations, but not with the spirit and purpose outlined in these agreements.     Scope of International Obligations  3. The UK has legal, normative and moral obligations in granting asylum and in upholding freedom of religion or belief.  The UK has ratified the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees including the corresponding 1967 Protocol, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).  4. The UK takes its international obligations seriously, and has made significant efforts to ensure its own domestic compliance.  For example, the UK offers refuge to those who are fleeing persecution in compliance with the refugee convention.  However, there are concerns over the process of assessment of eligibility for asylum.  Additionally, there are concerns over compliance with freedom of religion obligations when assessing asylum seekers.  5. Recommendation: The State Party should ensure that its policy, procedures and practice around reviewing asylum applications and general treatment of asylum seekers are wholly consistent with its obligations under international law.   Constitutional and Legislative Framework  6. There are several legislative acts that govern asylum and immigration in the UK.  There are minor territorial variations in legislative application across the UK due to the devolution process, but generally a consistent approach is applied across the country.  7. National legislation comprehensively details the regulation of the asylum process in the UK.  The domestic political situation within the UK means that asylum is a high-profile policy issue that features prominently in public debate around Parliamentary elections.  Immigration has been a focus issue for political parties prior to each of the last two general elections, and such debate has resulted in policy changes, including the implementation of quotas.  8. Such politicised debate has led to an emphasis on seeking to control numbers of asylum seekers entering or remaining in the UK at the potential expense of the protection of the human rights of the  November 2011 UPR  13th Session  UK CSW  Stakeholder Submission Page 2 of 5   asylum seekers themselves.  Consequently, while asylum policies ought to be focused on the technicalities of implinvariably the fulfilment of political promises are prioritised at the expense of ensuring the rights of those genuinely fleeing persecution.  ure of disbelief has been cited as problematic, and is illustrated by statistics.  This is an implicit assumption, particularly on first review, that an asylum claim is likely to be invalid or false. 1  On average there are 20,000 asylum applications in the UK per year.  Of these, approximately 29 percent are successful, with 71 percent failing.  Those who go on to appeal the initial decision experience a 25 percent chance that the original decision will be overturned.2  This means that for every case that is initially accepted, there is an almost similar number that initially fail, but are in reality deserving of protection.    9. Recommendation: The State Party should ensure that immigration and asylum processes are implemented by an independent, non-political body to ensure treaty obligations are no longer subject to political exigencies.   Interaction with International Human Rights Mechanisms  10. The UK enthusiastically engages with international human rights mechanisms and has issued a standing invitation to all of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.  11. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief visited the UK in 2007 and issued a subsequent report3 which highlighted concerns over the testing of the claims of asylum seekers on freedom of religion or belief grounds.  12. Similarly, the UK was reviewed by the Human Rights Committee in 2008 with respect to its 4 indicated poor treatment of asylum seekers, including lack of adequate legal representation.  13. Recommendation: The State Party is urged to ensure that issues highlighted by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and the Human Rights Committee relating to asylum are adequately addressed.   The Right to Seek Asylum  14. There are four key issues related to seeking asylum in the UK: cuts to legal aid, added burden of the independence and quality of interpreters.  These issues taken together have a cumulative effect of creating biases that can adversely affect compliance with international obligations.                                                          1 http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/migobs/Asylum%20Policy%20Primer_0.pdf (accessed November, 2011) 2 UK Home Office Website, http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/immigration-asylum-research/control-immigration-q1-2011-t/ (accessed November, 2011) 3 A/HRC/7/10/Add.3 4 CCPR/C/GBR/CO  November 2011 UPR  13th Session  UK CSW  Stakeholder Submission Page 3 of 5   15. The design of the asylum system in the UK is particularly onerous on those claiming a right to protection from persecution.  It is a complex legal system which requires competent legal advice for an asylum seeker to understand the processing of their application.  The wider financial concerns in the UK have had an adverse effect on the asylum system.  Cuts and restrictions made to government-funded legal aid deprive many applicants of legal representation.  This is especially the case following the rejection of an application, or during a family reunification claim after refugee or humanitarian status has been granted.  Further cuts to legal aid would almost certainly have a negative effect on obligations under the Refugee Convention.  16. A second issue is the .  The decision process for each asylum claim is evidence-based; a case owner assesses the claim, consulting with UK guidelines.  However due to nt is akin to an adversarial court system.  The applicant not only has to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution and that they are a member of a particular social group (as outlined in the Refugee Convention), but must also prove that they are a credible witness.  Although this is an implicit requirement, it clearly contradicts   17. Government targets for processing asylum cases can also prove problematic.  Recently a government target was set specifying the processing of 90 percent of all asylum cases within six months of application.  Irrespective of whether this target is met, there is a clear push towards efficiency targets.  Target-driven processing can occasion pressures resulting in situations where key experiences that claimants have faced are overlooked, or salient cultural differences that require time to overcome are not taken into consideration.  18. Many asylum seekers have faced appalling and traumatizing situations in their countries of origin.  In addition many have experienced additional distress when making their journey to safety in the UK.  After enduring these circumstances, applicants find it hard to speak of what they have faced; precise time-based targets will often exacerbate the situation for these vulnerable individuals.    19. In a pressurised environment, cultural nuances can be missed or misinterpreted.  With policy focusing on increasing the speed of processing asylum claims, vital information may not be communicated by the applicant due to such factors.  Moreover when applicants have later divulged information, these facts are often treated with suspicion, and interpreted as an attempt to bolster an application. The current focus for a speedy assessment period does not guarantee that all the relevant factors are provided, potentially working against the claimant.    20. Many of those seeking asylum in the UK are not conversant in English.  Understandably, the use of interpreters is vital in assessing claims.  However the selection of interpreters needs to be done with care.  In the case of Zainuddin Umer Khail (2009-10), an interpreter made inaccurate interpretations .  Ultimately Mr case failed at first instance and had to go to appeal.  Such errors in interpretation can be very damaging for individual cases and add anxiety to difficult situation.  21.  Another issue with regard to interpreters is intentional mistranslation.  A case which highlights this is that of Maged Malaka Eskondr Youssif (2011).  This was a case where an Egyptian Christian family was fleeing persecution on the grounds of religion.  During their interviews, the family was given a Muslim translator whom they believed was intentionally mistranslating.  Following incorrectly interpreted answers regarding their faith, the case owner gave a negative ruling in their case.  The case highlights the importance of independent, non-prejudiced interpreters in cases of asylum, especially when dealing with issues of religious persecution.    November 2011 UPR  13th Session  UK CSW  Stakeholder Submission Page 4 of 5    22. Furthermore, the process for selecting interpreters should take into consideration the complex socio-dynamics that exist in related countries and their international diaspora.  This has been highlighted in the asylum cases of Eritreans:  23. sympathisers who fled Ethiopian rule but stayed on after Eritrean independence.  Government supporters are militant in defending their country and president with quasi-religious zeal and often with threats of violence and actual physical violence.  Consequently, anyone who speaks openly about the current realities in Eritrea cannot expect to find assistance from these groups, but is likely instead to face severe harassment.  There are also growing concerns regarding the impartiality of pro-government interpreters during asylum interviews, and fears that information divulged on such occasions may eventually fall into the hands of the Eritrean government, to the detriment of the 5  24. Special care needs to be taken to ensure the impartiality and confidentiality of interpreters so that those rightfully seeking protection under the refugee convention are guaranteed it.    25. Recommendation: The State Party should review the impact of legal-aid cuts on the asylum process to ensure that reduced funds do not have a negative impact.  The State Party should also culture of .  Finally, the State Party should implement a more rigorous system in selecting independent, non-prejudiced interpreters.   Freedom of Thought, Conscience and Religion   26. The UK has a long-term and proven commitment to freedom of religion or belief.  However the manner in which assessment is made in asylum cases regarding whether an individual qualifies for asylum is unnecessarily restrictive, and could amount to a violation of international obligations.  27. does not necessarily allow for cultural context, personal preference or individual expression.  Christians that suffer human rights violations but who do not fit within this particular categorisation will struggle to answer questions in the assessment, and are therefore less-likely to be granted protection.  Examples of questions posed to Christians include:  To name the books of the Bible;  To name the twelve disciples;  To name four Christian events and when they are celebrated;6  To name the period leading up to Christmas called?7   28. The main problem with this approach has been highlighted by the United Kingdom Evangelical Alliance (EA) in a report on asylum, which suggests that the questions are irrelevant in ascertaining whether someone is truly a Christian or not.  Furthermore, when the EA canvassed its own  largely                                                        6 Case of Maged Malaka Eskondr Youssif (2011) 7 http://www.eauk.org/public-affairs/socialjustice/upload/alltogether-for-asylum-justice.pdf (accessed November, 2011)  November 2011 UPR  13th Session  UK CSW  Stakeholder Submission Page 5 of 5   Christian  membership, 90 percent of the respondents agreed such questions were irrelevant in determining whether someone was a Christian.8  29. A joint briefing by CSW and the EA on Eritrea highlights the traditional European nature of the questions.  Christians in other parts of the world can have different theological frames of reference.  Furthermore in situations where Christians routinely face human rights violations, and where freedom of assembly is curtailed, formal or traditional teaching on any given religion can be inconsistent.  Moreover, only allowing for a proscribed definition of religious believer does not reflect the diversity allowed for under UN definitions of freedom of religion or belief.  g to erroneous rejection of some applications.  30. There are also additional hurdles faced by asylum seekers who come from a background of apostasy or conversion from another religion.  According to one confidential source, It would appear that there is a genrights violations they have faced.  31. Asad Ullah Niaz (2010), whose religion was questioned by the judge overseeing his hearing.  In response Mr Niaz confirmed he was a genuine convert who was compelled by his faith to share it with others, but that in doing so faced possible death if returned to Pakistan, where Christian apostates face severe human rights violations.  The would risk his life to convert Muslims there, then he would accept the consequences he predicts and would not apply to remain in the United Kingdom to protect him from the consequences of his own   By making such a remark, the judge effectively questioned Mr manifest his religion.  32. Recommendation: The State Party should review the criteria used to verify the genuine religion or belief of asylum applicants and ensure that a correct definition of freedom of religion or belief, as enshrined in international law, is understood at all levels within the asylum process and that applicants are treated appropriately and accordingly.                                                        8 Ibid.

The expansion of the use of long-term detention of migrants without time limit and the detained accelerated asylum process are emerging human rights issues in the UK.  The UK routinely detains foreign ex-offenders for periods of years, when the prospects of deportation are remote.  The practice of long-term immigration detention risks breaching Articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Around 9% of asylum claims are processed on the Detained Fast Track, in which asylum-seekers are detained for increasing periods in inappropriate conditions.  This use of detention for the purpose of administrative convenience in processing asylum claims may breach Article 26 of the 1951 Refugee Convention and Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  About Detention Action  2. Detention Action (formerly London Detainee Support Group) is a national charity established in 1993 that aims to change the way that migrants are treated by immigration detention policy in the UK.  Detention Action defends the rights and improves the welfare of people in detention by combining support for individuals with campaigning for policy change.  Detention Action works primarily in Harmondsworth and Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centres, near Heathrow Airport in London.  All primary evidence and quotes are taken from our casework and reports, unless otherwise stated.    3. Long-term detention of migrants without time limit  4. Migrants are frequently deprived of their liberty for periods of years without charge for purely administrative purposes, in stark contrast to the limitation on detention of terrorist suspects which currently stands at 14 days.  According to the latest UK Border Agency (UKBA) statistics, of the total of 2,685 people detained, 407 people (15%) had been detained for over six months at 30 June 2011.  Of these, 217 people had been detained for over a year and 74 had been detained for over 2 years.12  These figures understate the true scale of the problem in that they arbitrarily exclude immigration detainees who have been held in prison throughout their detention, who may experience some of the longest periods of detention.                                                             1 UKBA, Immigration Statistics April - June 2011, available at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/immigration-asylum-research/immigration-tabs-q2-2011v2/detention-q2-11-tabs 2 These figures understate the true scale of the problem because they exclude immigration detainees who have been held in prison throughout their detention, who may experience some of the longest periods of detention.   3 Detention Action, registered charity 1065066 Unit 3R, Leroy House, 436 Essex Rd, London N1 3QP, Tel: 020 7226 3114, admin@detentionaction.org.uk, www.detentionaction.org.uk  5. Migrants can be held in immigration detention under powers contained in the 1971 3  The UKBA policy states 4  However, UK is one of the few countries in Europe which uses immigration detention without time limit, having derogated from the EU Returns Directive that sets a maximum time limit of 18 months.  As a result, the UK detains more migrants for longer periods than any other country in Europe.  6. Many NGOs, domestic monitoring bodies and international observers have been alarmed by a dramatic increase in the numbers of migrants being detained for long periods over the last five years, following increased media concern over the deportation of foreign ex-offenders.   For example, the Chief Inspector of the UK Border Agency criticised a culture of the detention of foreign ex-5  The Committee on Migration, Refugees and Population of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of first resort and not last resort, (that) can be prolonged, particularly where there is 6  The Committee identified the   7. Detention becomes protracted where a migrant is considered by the UKBA to be unsuitable for release, yet intractable barriers exist to their deportation.  Some countries, such as Somalia, are too dangerous for forced deportations to take place7, and other states routinely refuse to issue emergency travel documents to their nationals.8   Yet the UK continues to detain nationals of these countries for long periods.  8. Migrants in detention have the right to apply to the First Tier Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber for bail.  However, the quality of scrutiny of bail applications has been criticised by NGOs.9  In particular, ex-offenders are rarely                                                            3 UK Border Agency, Enforcement Instructions and Guidance, 55.2 4 ibid.,  55.1.3 5 Independent Chief Inspector of the UK Border Agency, A thematic inspection of how the UK Border Agency manages foreign national prisoners, November 2011, 6.15 6 Committee on Migration, Refugees and Population, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, The detention of asylum seekers and irregular migrants in Europe, 11 January 2010, para. 5  7 Forced returns to Somalia have not generally been possible for many years, as a result of Rule 39 letters issues by the European Court of Human Rights and the recent judgment in the case of Sufi and Elmi. See Sufi and Elmi v UK (Applications nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07) 8 See for example Human Rights Watch, Eritrea: Service for Life: State Repression and Indefinite Conscription in Eritrea, (2009), p75-77, Bail for Immigration Detainees, Travel Document Project,  http://www.biduk.org/543/country-information/country-information.html 9 Bail for Immigration Detainees, A Nice Judge on a Good Day, July 2010, Close Campsfield Campaign, Immigration Bail Hearings: A Travesty of Justice?, March 2011   4 Detention Action, registered charity 1065066 Unit 3R, Leroy House, 436 Essex Rd, London N1 3QP, Tel: 020 7226 3114, admin@detentionaction.org.uk, www.detentionaction.org.uk  granted bail, even where there is little prospect of deportation, due to the perceived risk of reoffending or absconding.    9. The potential arbitrariness of long-term detention is demonstrated by Detention , which provided evidence that long-term detention is not an effective tool for ensuring deportations.   If deportation has not been possible after a year, continued detention is unlikely to make it become possible.  Of the 167 indefinite detainees whose cases were monitored over several years, a clear majority (57%) were finally released.  Only a third (34%) of the detainees were deported.   Almost one in ten of the detainees (9%) remained in detention.  The 188 detainees in the initial survey group had been held for a total of 399 years, an average of 25 months each.10    10. documented the impact of indefinite detention on the mental health of detainees.  Interviews with 24 detainees held for over a year revealed a picture of endemic mental disorder and distress. Interviewees described witnessing other detainees self-harming or attempting suicide. 21% of interviewees described symptoms of mental disorder, including hearing voices, talking to themselves and memory problems, despite having no previously diagnosed conditions. 8% described harming themselves, and 13% described suicidal feelings.11   11.  - Mohammed Ali Saad, detained 2 years, interviewed for .12  12. Since 2009, the UK has seen a sharp increase in the number of findings of unlawful detention by the High Court.  Between 2009 and early 2011, the High Court ruled on 15 occasions that a detainee held for over year with little prospect of removal was dwarfed by the number of occasions on which the UKBA has agreed to release a detainee before an unlawful detention action reached the court.  The Home Office paid out £3 million in 2008-09 and £12 million in 2009-10 in compensation and legal costs arising from unlawful detention actions.13    13. In the case of Sino, whom Detention Action supported, the High Court found that an Algerian national with a psychological disorder and a history of minor offending had been detained unlawfully for the entirety of his 4 years and 11 months in                                                            10 London Detainee Support Group (now Detention Action), No Return No Release No Reason, 2010, p8 11 London Detainee Support Group (now Detention Action), Detained Lives, p22 12 ibid. 13 Baroness Neville-Jones, Minister of State, Home Office, Hansard 29 Nov 2010 : Column WA410   5 Detention Action, registered charity 1065066 Unit 3R, Leroy House, 436 Essex Rd, London N1 3QP, Tel: 020 7226 3114, admin@detentionaction.org.uk, www.detentionaction.org.uk  immigration detention.14  This is thought to be the longest ever period of unlawful immigration detention in the UK.  The court found that there was at no point any prospect of his deportation becoming possible in a reasonable period, so there was never a power to detain him.  Efforts to obtain a travel document had been unsuccessful for three years prclear at the outset that further efforts would prove unsuccessful.  14. Over the last three months, the High Court has on two occasions found that the prolonged detention of mentally disordered people amounted to breaches of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Both litigants received support from Detention Action.    15. ruled for the first time that the detention of a man with severe mental illness had amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment in breach of Article 3.  The Court made clear that it would have found that Article 8 was also breached, had it been necessary to do so.  S had a history of serious ill treatment and abuse prior to arriving in the UK which had been accepted by a number of medical experts. After serving a prison sentence, he was sectioned under mental health legislation until April 2010, when he was transferred to immigration detention, despite evidence that detention caused deterioration in his psychotic state.  he UKBA was found to have breached the negative and positive obligations under Article 3.15  16. A second finding of breaches of Articles 3 and 8 in October 2011 concerned BA, a Nigerian with a criminal conviction for smuggling drugs, who was detained between June and October 2011.  He had been assessed by the Probation Service as low risk of reoffending or serious harm to the public.  He was twice sectioned under the Mental Health Act during his prison sentence, with evidence of psychosis and refusal of fluids.  By July 2011, the UKBA had been informed by the Healthcare Manager at Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre that he was not fit to be detained as he could die imminently due to his refusal of fluids.  After a spell in hospital, he was transferred back to detention, in breach of a court order.  He was not released until a further order from the High Court on 7 October.  In finding a breach of Article 3, the High Cou16                                                             14 Sino, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] EWHC 2249 (Admin) (25 August 2011) 15 S, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department, [2011] EWHC 2120 (Admin), (5 August 2011), para 212. 16 BA, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department, [2011] EWHC 2748 (Admin) (26 October 2011)   6 Detention Action, registered charity 1065066 Unit 3R, Leroy House, 436 Essex Rd, London N1 3QP, Tel: 020 7226 3114, admin@detentionaction.org.uk, www.detentionaction.org.uk  Recommendation 1: The UK should protect migrants from arbitrary long-term detention through adopting a maximum time limit for detention.  The evidence shows that extended detention more often leads to release than deportation.  The UK should follow best practice in the EU and implement a time limit of one month.   Recommendation 2: Likelihood of imminent deportation should have priority in decisions by UKBA and the Tribunal to initiate and continue detention.   Where deportation is not imminent, it can be pursued while the person is in the community.  Recommendation 3: Where deportation is not imminent, community-based alternatives to detention should always be used.  UKBA should study the successes of the Swedish and Australian models, which have achieved high rates of voluntary return through an emphasis on dialogue with asylum seekers and migrants in the community.  The Detained Fast Track asylum process  17. The UK detains asylum-seekers on the Detained Fast Track asylum process (DFT), in order to process their asylum claims quickly.  Detention for the purpose of administrative convenience in processing asylum claims appears to breach Article 26 of the 1951 Refugee Convention, as some asylum-seekers on the process are ultimately recognised as refugees.    18. Asylum-seekers on the DFT are detained throughout the asylum process.  Men are usually held in Harmondsworth IRC and women at Yarls Wood IRC.  Their claims are processed according to accelerated timescales.  Over 2,000 asylum seekers are detained in this way per year, around 9% of claimants. In 2009, 23% of people on Detained Fast Track were from Afghanistan.  19. The DFT  screening out vulnerable people with complex cases is impossible, as the decision to detain an asylum-seeker is taken before any detailed questions are asked about the nature of their claim.  UKBA guidance contains a presumption that the majority of asylum applications are suitable for the DFT, unless there is evidence to suggest otherwise.17  Significant numbers of torture victims and mentally disordered people go onto the DFT.18  A DFT process for women operates in Yarls Wood IRC, despite the complexities and the obstacles to early disclosure associated with the high prevalence of histories of rape and sexual violence.19   The selection of cases for the Detained Fast                                                            17 UKBA, DFT and DNSA - Intake Selection (AIU Instruction), 2.2 18 Medical Foundation for the Care of the Victims of Torture, quoted in Detention Action, Fast Track to Despair, May 2010, p31 19 Bail for Immigration Detainees, process at Yarls Wood Immigration Removal Centre, 2007, p19-20   7 Detention Action, registered charity 1065066 Unit 3R, Leroy House, 436 Essex Rd, London N1 3QP, Tel: 020 7226 3114, admin@detentionaction.org.uk, www.detentionaction.org.uk  Track risks appearing arbitrary, yet in Harmondsworth 99% of claims are refused by the UK Border Agency.20    20. The timescales on DFT risk breaching the rights of asylum-seekers.  Policy documents set out tight deadlines, reflecting the gravity of depriving migrants of liberty in order to process their asylum claims.  UKBA policy states that they should be interviewed on day 2 of their detention.21    21. However, research in Detention Action has found that asylum-seekers are detained for an average of two weeks before the process even starts, due to administrative delays by the UKBA.22  18% wait for over a month in detention.23  Most have no access to legal advice for this period.  They then face an asylum process at breakneck speed, in most cases meeting their duty solicitor on the morning of their asylum interview with no advance notice.  They are given only two days to gather evidence for and submit an appeal.  Finally, they spend an average of 58 days in detention awaiting removal.  22. Case study: John B spent 34 days in detention after claiming asylum before he was allocated a solicitor.  His asylum interview was the next day.  He was refused on day 39 of his detention.  He was released on bail after 184 days in detention.24  23. Asylum-seekers in Harmondsworth are often held in high security conditions equivalent to a Category B prison.  Interviews with 45 asylum-research found that the majority were confused and distressed, struggling to understand the complex asylum procedure in a hostile and stressful environment.25    24. Just living under these circumstances, I feel I will go crazy just from thinki- Asif from Pakistan, asylum-26  25. The majority (63%) of asylum-seekers on the DFT are unrepresented on appeal,27 in most cases following decisions by their legal aid duty solicitors that their cases have insufficient merit.  It is in the interests of justice that free legal advice be provided to                                                            20 UKBA, Freedom of Information Act response, 3/2/11 21 UKBA, Detained Fast Track and Detained NSA, 9 September 2009, quoted in Detention Action, Fast Track to Despair, May 2011, p11 22 Detention Action, op cit, p4 23 ibid, p22 24 ibid, p23 25 ibid, p18 26 ibid, p16-18.   27 448 of 711 cases, January - September 2010.

Detention Action believes that the DFT is no longer necessary.  It was developed in 2000 as a response to unprecedented numbers of asylum claims and an increasing backlog.  However, the number of asylum applications has fallen by 79% since 2002, processing times have been reduced, and the backlog has largely been resolved.  Yet the DFT continues to expand, increasing by 39% in 2009.    27. In the case of Saadi, the European Court of Human Rights held in 2008 that detention low security centre did not breach Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.28  The court took into account the necessity to ensure the speedy resolution of the large numbers of asylum applications at that time.  However, since Dr Saadi was detained in 2000, the lengths of time that asylum-seekers are detained have increased, they are detained in centres with far higher security levels, and the pressure of numbers of asylum claims has greatly reduced.  Given these changes, the operation of the DFT today risks breaching Article 5.  Recommendation 4: The UK should take steps to ensure compliance with Article 26 of the Refugee Convention and Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The abolition of the DFT is likely to be necessary to ensure full compliance.  Recommendation 5: If the DFT is to be retained, the UK should take steps to ensure that vulnerable and complex cases are not arbitrarily routed into the DFT, in breach of policy.  This will require thorough reform of the screening process.    Recommendation 6: Asylum-seekers on the DFT should be provided with a legal representative on their second day in detention at the latest.    Recommendation 7: Sufficient time should be allocated to allow asylum-seekers and their legal representatives to fully prepare their cases and gather evidence.

16,DP - Disability Politics,"1 | Page  Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW  Submission  Disability Politics UK   November 2011             Disability Politics UK www.disabilitypolitics.org.uk 80 Otterfield Road Yiewsley West Drayton Middlesex UB7 8PF    2 | Page  Disability Politics UK  1. Disability Politics UK has been formed to promote Article 29 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The CRPD was ratified by the United Kingdom Government on 8 June 2009 and the Optional Protocol was ratified on 7 August 2009. The United Kingdom is a member of the European Union. The European Union ratified the CRPD on 23 December 2010. 2. guarantee to persons with disabilities political rights and the   Round Table meeting with the Minister 3. A Round Table meeting was held on 9th May 2011 between a number of charities and individuals with Maria Miller MP, Minister for Disabled People. This was to dis consultation paper issued by the United Kingdom Government. At that meeting it became apparent there was a need for an organisation like Operation Black Vote1 for disabled people. The process of getting people together to form Disability Politics UK started at that meeting. Disability Politics UK is a new organisation which is planning to register as a company limited by guarantee and at the time of writing has held two meetings with interested individuals.  4. A proposal was put forward to the Minister at the Round Table meeting for the law to be changed to enable Members of the United Kingdom Parliament to be able to job share2.   A 300 signature petition in support of allowing Members of Parliament to job share  5. A 300 signature paper petition had been collected which read recognise that for some disabled people (and others), a main barrier to being able to participate in public and political life is that it is not currently possible to job share as a Member of Parliament therefore we ask that the law be changed to allow MPs to serve on a job share basis  6. The paper petition signatures had been collected from a variety of different places mainly in the London Borough of Hillingdon, the borough in which Heathrow Airport is based. The people who were asked to sign were from various groups including the                                                            1 Operation Black Vote exists to ensure there is greater racial justice and equality throughout the UK.OBV works exclusively within the democratic and civic framework to deliver their objectives. Operation Black Vote is the first initiative to focus exclusively on the Black democratic deficit in the UK. OBV aims for a strong political voice for African, Asian, Caribbean, Chinese and other ethnic minorities.   2 Stand as joint candidates with equal but shared responsibility for the obligations of the office.  3 | Page  West Drayton Hillingdon Citizens Advice Bureau, Hillingdon MIND - a mental health charity, a local Mosque, a local Church and signatures were It was thus a good cross section of society and proper notice should have been taken of the petition signatories views. 7. The leaflet which signatories to the petition were provided with on request set out the need for a change in the law. 8. The United Kingdom Parliament currently elects Members of Parliament on the basis of a single Member of Parliament for each constituency.  9. The presenting of 2 or more candidates for election for one constituency seat is currently not possible. The legislation always refers to ""the candidate"" or ""the return of a Member of Parliament"". The Royal writ of election also uses the singular - it reads:   ""[...] Whereas by the advice of Our council We have ordered a Parliament to be holden at Westminster on X We Command you that due notice being first given you do cause election to be made according to law of a Member to serve in Parliament for the said Constituency and that you do cause the name of such Member when so elected whether he be present or absent to be certified to Us in Our Chancery without delay.""  10. The actual legislative reference that says that each constituency is to return to the House of Commons a single member. Section 1(1) of the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 reads:  ""There shall for the purpose of parliamentary elections be the county and borough constituencies (or in Scotland the county and burgh constituencies), each returning a single member, which are described in orders in Council made under this Act.""  Flexible working is better for lots of groups of people  job sharing can create access to politics and a truly representative Parliament 11. Enabling Members of Parliament to job share would enable more disabled people to get elected and help to create a truly representative House of Commons. For people with some disabilities, working a full week is not possible, particularly after travelling long distances on public transport to get to Parliament. 12. Job sharing would also make it easier for members of other groups to become or remain Members of Parliament:  Parents of young children  Carers  Older MPs who want to ease themselves into retirement gradually  People who have a second job and who want to keep it. At present some Members of Parliament have 2 or 3 additional jobs and think that being a Member of Parliament is not a full time commitment.   4 | Page  How would it work in practice? 13. Only one half of the job sharing pair would vote. NB. The vast majority of votes in the United Kingdom party based on an election manifesto. This means there would be no difference in voting between the two job sharing MPs. Conscience votes 14. In election literature, Members of Parliament rarely set out how they would vote on conscience issues. If there were to be a vote without a whip on a conscience matter, in the event that the job sharers disagreed, job sharing Members of Parliament could t Pay and expenses 15. Only one salary and one set of allowances would be paid, so it would not cost any more than electing one Member of Parliament.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 16. Article 2 of the CRPD requires signatory countries to make reasonable accommodation: y and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms;   Article 4 of the CRPD requires signatory countries:  b) To take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices that constitute discrimination against persons with   Work and employment  17. Article 27 of the CRPD requires signatory countries to recognise the   right to the opportunity to gain a living by work freely chosen or accepted in a labour market and work environment that is open, inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities      Participation in political and public life  5 | Page   18. Article 29 of the CRPD environment in which persons with disabilities can effectively and fully participate in the conduct of public affairs, without discrimination and on an equal basis with others Has this affected any candidates in practice? 19. An ability to job share might facilitate more talented women agreeing to enter and stay in Parliament. In 1999, Lorraine Mann sought to stand on a job-sharing basis as a candidate to be a Member of the Scottish Parliament for the Highlands and Islands Alliance. The returning officer said that he did not think that this was permissible and Ms Mann brought proceedings under the Sex Discrimination Act. She was represented in the employment tribunal by Shona Simon (now President of the Employment Tribunals  Scotland) and won on a preliminary point that the office of Member of s.13(1) of the Sex Discrimination Act. However, the Employment Appeal Tribunal allowed an appeal on grounds that an employment tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear complaints relating to election law. 20. In the 2010 General Election, Deborah King, an unemployed disabled woman who could not work full time, sought to stand as a parliamentary candidate on the basis of a job share. She was informed by the Electoral Services Manager at the London Borough of Hillingdon that the advice of the Electoral Commission had been sought and that there was currently no provision to allow a parliamentary candidate to job share the role of Member of Parliament. This is because the Representation of the Peo Deborah King did not bring proceedings as she is unemployed and ineligible for Legal Aid as her partner works full time and their joint income exceeds the threshold for being granted Legal Aid. 21. Disability Politics UK is seeking to change the law to allow MPs to serve on a job share basis as this would enable more disabled people to access elected office. Disability Politics UK has started an e-petition in order to get a Parliamentary debate on this issue. http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/17076  Please recommend a law change in the United Kingdom to permit Members of Parliament to serve on a job share basis   22. Disability Politics UK urges the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to support the 300 signatories and advise the United Kingdom government to change the law to enable Members of Parliament to job share. This will help to ensure that their duties under Articles 2, 4, 27 and 29 of the CRPD are fulfilled on this issue. 23. Thank you for your assistance in this matter. We await your response with interest.

17,Engender - Engender," 1    Universal Periodic Review Report submitted by Engender, a non-governmental organisation in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council.  Engender  feminist, anti-sexist agenda. Established in 1990, our aim is to make visible the impact of sexism on women, men, children, society and on our social, cultural, economic, and political development. We do this by making the eqinfluence. Our policy priorities are wowomen and win public life.  1a Haddington Place  Edinburgh EH7 4AE  Scotland  UK info@engender.org.uk     www.engender.org.uk  +44 131 558 9596    Engender has chosen to focus this report on two priority areas: participation in public life  and s poverty.   We wish to reference, however, the submission of the UK Joint Committee on Women, which we attach here in an appendix, and whose recommendations we support.  We also wish to add particular support for the following recommendations made by the Scottish Human Rights Commission in their UPR report, with some added comment:  Recommendation 2: That the UK ratify and incorporate all human rights treaties without reservation.  Engender would add a recommendation that the Scottish government incorporate CEDAW and ICESCR commitments into Scottish law.  Recommendation 4: That steps by the Scottish Government to introduce a   2 obligations and is not an alternative to incorporation.   Recommendation 7: That the Scottish and UK Governments support the integration of human rights indicators into monitoring and accountability of public services and the development of equality and human rights impact assessment processes.    Recommendation 16: That the UK and Scottish Governments consider steps to ensure that the minimum wage is sufficient at least to secure an adequate standard of living.  Engender recommends an additional commitment be madethat both governments commit to a gendered analysis of poverty policy and to publish action plans for addressing the disproportion of women and children living in poverty.   And finally, Engender would add a recommendation to this list regarding the extent to which the private sector has human rights obligations (particularly but not exclusively with regard to employment). There is some evidence that the positive changes in the public sector in terms of flexible working practice actually reduced child poverty in Scotland. Although such progress is now under threat due to public sector job cuts, the progress made was notably not similarly reflected in the private sector.   Both Scots and UK legislation continue to be unclear about the extent to which private bodies providing public services have human rights obligations. The continued failure of the UK and Scottish government to hold the private sector to account to human rights obligations serves to undermine progress, particularly for women and children.    Recommendation:  that UK and Scottish governments extend human rights obligations accountability to the private sector.       3 1  As the Equality and Human Rights Commission states,   The progress of women to positions of authority in Scotland, and in Britain, has been tortuously slowWomen in this country are better educated than ever before. They are graduating from university in ever increasing numbers and achieve better degree results than men. Intelligent, competent women are flooding the junior ranks of law firms, accountancies and medical practices.    These women step on the career ladder and work hard, with the corner office firmly in sight. In their twenties they level peg with men and therefore we would expect them to enter the management ranks at the same rate as men. However, several years down the track a different picture emerges  one where many have disappeared from the paid workforce or remain trapped in the  leaving the higher ranks to be dominated by men  The EHRC survey measured the number of women in positions of power or influence in Scotland and, more generally, in Britain in 2010-11.  The conclusions were that there is no discernible upward trend, and that increases have been small. For example, women members of the Scottish Parliament increased from 34.1 percent to 34.9 percent, but the latter figure is still significantly less than the figure from 2003 (39.5 percent). The proportion of women ministers in the Scottish Government increased less than 1 percent.                                                   1 Sex and Power Scotland 2011.  We have attached a copy of the report as an appendix.   4 In local government, the percentage of women local authority council leaders halved since 2007-08. The proportion of women holding public appointments in now less than in 2003.  Volupower, participation and decision making are failing.  At the existing pace, women will have equal representation in the Scottish Parliament by approximately 2055 and it would be even later at Westminster.  This is not good enough.  It is time for the Scottish and UK governments to take responsibility.  It is clear that the political parties will not bring about the change needed, and we have the following recommendations:   Quotas aimed at candidate selection should be compulsory and enshrined in law.2      Quotas must be  candidates are placed.  Training and mentoring programmes should also be continued  We also need sanctions for noncompliance.  These could be financial penalties or disqualification of candidates or deregistration of parties.  Recommendation:  The UK and Scottish government should adopt legislation that would use special measures to redress the unequal approach.                                                    2 Engender held a debate on quotas and other special measures at the Scottish Parliament in August 2011 as part of the Edinburgh Festival of Politics.  See www.engender.org.uk for details.   5   poverty In the first session of the UPR, the UK accepted to information with regard to efforts to reduce poverty among children in half   However, there has been no progress in reducing the number of children living in severe poverty since 2004/05.i   In March 2011, the Scottish Government produced the first Child Poverty Strategy for Scotlandii  to set out its commitment to tackling poverty and the socio-economic disadvantage of children.  Engender welcome the first evidence of a gendered approach in government child poverty policy evidenced in the references to the gender pay gap and to the fact that the vast manalysis fails to extend to concrete plans for lifting children out of poverty through directly addressing the poverty of their mothers.    Recommendation:  The Scottish and UK governments integrate the child    Appendix 1  Sex and Power Scotland 2011, Equality and Human Rights Commission  Missing women The progress of women to positions of authority in Scotland, and in Britain, has been - an index of women in positions of power and influence - shows a trend which is not abating; while women make progress in some sectors, that progress regularly stalls or even reverses in other sectors. It is a trend of waxing and waning; not one of constant upward movement.  Women in this country are better educated than ever before. They are graduating from university in ever increasing numbers and achieve better degree results than meniii. Intelligent, competent women are flooding the junior ranks of law firms, accountancies and medical practices.    These women step on the career ladder and work hard, with the corner office firmly in sight. In their twenties they level peg with men and therefore we would expect them to enter the management ranks at the same rate as men. However, several years down the track a different picture emerges  one where many have disappeared from the paid workforce or rthe higher ranks to be dominated by meniv.   These talented women are missing from the top jobs.  26,000 top positions of power, the Commission estimates that 5,4ranks to positions of real influence.     Findings   This survey measures the number of women in positions of power or influence  in Scotland and, more generally, in Britain in 2010/11.  For the Scottish study this year, 14 occupation categories were reviewed. The results show that there were more women in top posts in 10 of the 14 categories compared to 2007/08. These include:   local authority chief executives  senior police officers  university principals, and  health service chief executives.  However, increases have been small in most areas and in many cases the increases are attributable to just one or two women joining senior posts. For example, while there has been an increase in the proportion of members of the Scottish Parliament that are women - from 34.1 per cent to 34.9 per cent  this is still significantly less than the figure from 2003 (39.5 per cent). Similarly, for Scottish trade union general secretaries, the proportion of women in these posts rose from 20.6 per cent to just 25.7 per cent. For ministers in the Scottish Government, the increase is less than one percentage point.    2007/08 figures:     Scottish local authority council leaders  public appointments   Scottish MEPs, and  further education college principals.  The fall was most substantial with local authority council leaders. Since 2007/8, the percentage of council leaders who are women has halved, falling from 18.8 per cent to 9.4 per cent  from six female council leaders to only three.   There was also a reduction in the proportion of women holding public appointments. Even more worrying is that the proportion of women is less than it was in 2003.       Across Britain, the survey was wider, with 27 occupational categories being reviewed. The results show there were more women in top posts in 17 of the  27 categories in Britain compared to 2007/08. These include:  members of the senior judiciary  heads of professional bodies  chief executives of national sports bodies  senior police officers, and  trade union general secretaries.  Again, increases have been small in many areas and in many cases the increases are attributable to just one or two women joining senior posts. For example, for senior managers in the civil service the increase is from 26.6 per cent to 29.2 per cent. For senior ranks of the armed forces, the increase of three women brought  the percentage to only one per cent.   There hav   members of Cabinet (except Scotland)   National Assembly for Wales  local authority council leaders  public appointments   editors of national newspapers  chairs of national arts bodies, and  health service chief executives.    In three of these cases, falls have been substantial. The number of female chairs of arts companies had reached four in 2007/8. This year, that figure has fallen to one - Zoë van Zwanenberg at the Scottish Ballet.  The proportion of women Cabinet ministers is currently 17.4 per cent - effectively four women. The number of female editors of national newspapers has declined from a peak of four to two in 2011 - Dawn Neesom at the Daily Star and Tina Weaver at the Sunday Mirror.  0 years to  achieve an equal number of women directors in the FTSE 100 and another 45 years to achieve an equal number of women in the senior judiciary. It will take another     14 general elections  that is, up to 70 years - to achieve an equal number of  women MPs in the UK parliament.                                                   i Save the Children (2011).

18,ERT - The Equal Rights Trust,"                                         The Equal Rights Trust (ERT)  Stakeholder Submission to the:  Universal Periodic Review of the United Kingdom, 21 November 2011  The Human Rights of Stateless Persons in the United Kingdom          2    1. The Equal Rights Trust (ERT) is an independent international organisation whose purpose is to combat discrimination and promote equality as a fundamental human right and a basic principle of social justice.  2. Since May 2008, ERT has been carrying out research and advocacy on the human rights of stateless persons around the world, including in the United Kingdom. Over this period, ERT has developed strong links with other UK NGOs, which have also provided information for ERT to use in this submission.1   3. In this submission, ERT highlights some of the most significant concerns and challenges with regard to the human rights of stateless persons in the UK:  a. The lack of a statelessness determination procedure in the UK. b. Immigration detention practices which do not take into consideration the unique context of statelessness. c. Other human rights concerns, including enjoyment of socio-economic rights.  It is our view that the failure of the UK to systematically identify stateless persons subject to its jurisdiction, and the consequent failure of the UK to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of such persons under all aspects of its law and policy including in the exercise of immigration control, amounts to the violation of its international human rights obligations as well as its obligations under the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons (1954 Convention).2   The international law obligations of the United Kingdom 4. The UK has ratified many international human rights treaties including: a. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR);  b. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD); c. Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW); d. Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC);  e. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT); and  f. International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (CMW).   5. The UK is also party to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).3 Consequently, the UK has certain human rights obligations towards stateless persons within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction. ERT notes in particular that serious issues exist in respect to the right to a nationality,4 the rights to equality and non-discrimination,5 the right to freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman or                                                  1 ERT is particularly grateful to Asylum Aid (http://www.asylumaid.org.uk/) and Detention Action (http://www.detentionaction.org.uk/files/modules/content/?id=1) for their input to this submission.  2 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, ECOSOC RES/526 A(XVII)  (1954) (1954 Convention). 3 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as amended by Protocols No. 11 and No. 14 (4 November 1950) (ECHR). 4 See, for example, Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UNGA RES/217A (III) (1948), Article 24 of the ICCPR, and Article 7 of the CRC. 5 See, for example, Articles 2(1) and 2(2) of the ICCPR and ICESCR respectively, and Article 26 of the ICCPR.   3  degrading treatment or punishment,6 the right to liberty and freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention,7 the right to education,8 the right to the highest attainable standard of health,9 the right to work and related rights.10  6.  The UK is also party to a number of international treaties relevant to statelessness including the 1954 Convention, the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness,11 and the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.12  Statelessness within the UK 7. There is no accurate estimate of the total population of stateless persons in the UK. In part this is because the UK does not have a mechanism in place for the identification of stateless persons, and also because UK immigration statistics do not effectively capture the stateless population. In their study Mapping Statelessness in the United Kingom,13 UNHCR/Asylum Aid concluded that due to flaws in the 14  The report identifies various problems in the way stateless persons are recorded and categorised by the UK Border Agency (UKBA), including that nationality categories are  resulting in a number of important data sets.15 Consequently, not only is it impossible to count the stateless population in the country, but it also increases the risk that some 16  8. A de jure stateless person is defined under international law as a person .17 A person who cannot access or prove his or her nationality due to legal, administrative, procedural or practical barriers may also be considered de jure stateless under international law.18  9. A person who has a legal nationality which is ineffective - for example, a person who does not benefit from consular or diplomatic protection from his or her country of evident nationality, is considered to be de facto stateless.19 Persons sharing similar characteristics have also been referred to in the UK as unreturnable persons.20                                                  6 See, for example, CAT in general as well as Article 7 of the ICCPR.   7 See, for example, Article 9(1) of the ICCPR. 8 See, for example, Article 13 of the ICESCR. 9 See, for example, Article 12 of the ICESCR. 10 See Articles 6, 7 and 8 of the ICESCR. 11 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, G.A.

See also The Equal Rights Trust, Unravelling Anomaly: Detention, Discrimination and the Protection Needs of   4   10. Despite the lack of statistical information, our work in the UK and that of our partner organisations has led us to conclude that there are many de jure and de facto stateless persons in the UK who face significant human rights problems that must be addressed as a matter of urgency.   The lack of a statelessness determination procedure  11. One of the prerequisites to protecting stateless persons and ensuring their human rights is identifying them as stateless. This obligation is implicit to the 1954 Convention,21  and the UK has failed in this regard.    12. The failure to identify de jure and de facto stateless persons has resulted in a situation where they are subject to various human rights violations including lengthy and at times indefinite detention pending  violations include enforced destitution, violations of the right to privacy and family life, and of the right to work.   13. The following edited extract of a case study taken from  the UNHCR/Asylum Aid report illustrates the multiple human rights violations that can arise when statelessness is not identified and acted upon by the authorities:  22 Derek fled the civil war in Liberia in 1999 after his mother was killed, and was brought up in a refugee camp in Nigeria. He was never granted permanent residence or citizenship before travelling hidden in a container ship to the UK, arriving in April 2006 aged 19.   He claimed asylum and was detained in Harmondsworth Immigration Removals Centre, where his claim was considered in the detained fast track procedure. After seven months in immigration detention he was released because his removal could not be effected. The UKBA had received confirmation from both the Liberian and the Nigerian consular authorities that they did not accept Derek as a national. Each asserted that he was a national of the other country. Since then, no new evidence has come to light that either Liberia or Nigeria would be willing to treat him as a national, despite the fact that UK Border Agency officials continue to submit requests for him to be issued with an emergency travel document.  He was, at first, granted section 4 support and accommodation,23 but this has been stopped on four occasions because it was claimed that he was not cooperating with attempts to remove him. However, Derek applied twice for assisted voluntary return and was told by the International Organisation for Migration that he could not apply again.

In the report the interviewee is referred to as Derek but this is not his real name.  23 Support provided to refused asylum seekers under section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.   5   Derek is in a relationship with a British woman and they have a son together. Derek was dispersed to live in Birmingham and is forced to live apart from them.  Derek describes his anxiety to regularise his immigration status in order that he can be a proper father.   At the time of his interview, Derek was once again facing destitution. His solicitor sent a number of letters to the UKBA making further submissions, including on the basis that he is stateless, but all have been refused. Derek has been in limbo for 52 months.  14. ERT recommends that the UK follow the good practice of France, Hungary, Italy, Mexico and Spain, all of which have statelessness identification procedures in place, and develop an effective, accessible and fair procedure of its own. In this respect, ERT reiterates the recommendation made by UNHCR/Asylum Aid that he Home Office and UK Border Agency should develop an accessible under the 1954 and 1961 .24  15. The forthcoming ERT Guidelines on the Identification and Detention of Stateless Persons elaborate how existing human rights principles relating to detention and non-discrimination, and international law on statelessness apply to the specific challenges of the identification and detention of stateless .25 ERT recommends that the UK should draw from the Guidelines when developing a procedure for the identification of stateless persons, and that the UK should draw on the expertise of the UNHCR for this purpose.   16. Furthermore, ERT recommends that all refused asylum seekers and foreign ex-offenders who are at risk of removal are automatically subject to statelessness identification procedures, to ensure that any stateless persons amongst them are recognised and protected under international law.  The detention of stateless persons 17. One of the most significant concerns with regard to the treatment of stateless persons in the UK is its present immigration detention policy. Stateless persons in the UK  particularly those who are refused asylum seekers or foreign ex-offenders,26 are often subject to immigration detention for the purpose of removal from the UK.   18. Between April 2006 and September 2008, an unpublished policy of the UKBA established a presumption of detention in respect of all foreign ex-offenders. The Supreme Court ruled this to be unlawful.27 Consequently, this policy is no longer applied and the present policy contains some protections for stateless persons.28 However, ERT continues to have concerns over its implementation.                                                   24 See above, note 13, p. 89. 25 The Equal Rights Trust, Guidelines on the Identification and Detention of Stateless Persons, forthcoming. For a draft  in The Equal Rights Review, Vol. 7, 2011, pp. 105  116, available at: http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/ERR7_guidelines%20draft.pdf.  26 The UKBA refers to foreign ex- 27 Lumba (WL) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12. 28 See above, note 13, p. 109, for a more detailed examination of the situation.   6  19. de jure or de facto) is taken by the authorities at the time a decision to detain is made. The failure to identify statelessness at this stage, and consequently the failure to establish with due diligence whether the individual is removable within a reasonable period of time, and in compliance with the principle of non refoulement and other human rights principles, all can lead to arbitrary detention.  20. The UK has opted out of the European Return Directive which establishes a six month maximum time limit for immigration detention.29 Consequently, the UK is one of the very few countries in Europe which do not observe a maximum time limit for immigration detention. This, coupled with the failure of the UK to identify stateless persons within the immigration detention system, places the stateless at heightened risk of indefinite detention.   21. On 30 June 2011 there were 2685 people detained in immigration detention facilities. 217 people had been detained for more than one year and 74 had been detained for more than two years.30 There is no record of how many are de jure or de facto stateless.  22. These immigration statistics do not include detainees who are held in prison, as opposed to Immigration Removal Centres (IRC), after the end of their sentences. They also calculate the length of detention from the time of entry into IRC and do not include the time spent as immigration detainees in prison before transfer to an IRC.  This has led Detention Action to claim that .31  23. A study by Detention Action, which monitored 167 cases of indefinite detention over several years, found that .  Of this sample group, only one third were successfully deported. The average period of immigration detention across the whole sample group was 24 months.32  24. UNHCR/ participants had spent time in detention under immigration powers. The amount of time ranged from three days to five years.33    25. The following edited extract of a case study taken from the UNHCR/Asylum Aid report highlights the human rights concerns brought to light through the experience of one such detainee:                                                     29 European Union, Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals, 2008/115/EC, 16 December 2008. This time limit can be extended by a further twelve months in exceptional circumstances and subject to strict controls. 30 Home Office, Detention Data Tables: Immigration Statistics April 2011- June 2011, available at: http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/immigration-asylum-research/immigration-tabs-q2-2011v2/detention-q2-11-tabs. 31 Detention Action, Indefinite detention in the UK: Length of detention snapshot statistics for 1 June 2009 - Asylum Rights Campaign Detention Sub-Group, June 2009, available at: http://www.detainedlives.org/wp-content/uploads/ldsgreport-0609.pdf. 32 Detention Action, No Release, No Return, No Reason: Challenging Indefinite Detention, September 2011, available at: http://www.ldsg.org.uk/files/uploads/NoReasonReport0910.pdf. 33 See above, note 13, p. 104.   7  34 Kathem was born to Jewish parents in Naseriah, Iraq.  According to Kathem he was not recognised as an Iraqi citizen because he was Jewish. When he made enquiries about applying for full citizenship he was told that he was not eligible. When Kathem was 16 his father was arrested and killed by the authorities. Afterwards, Kathem himself came under threat by the authorities. He was forced to flee to the UK on a false document, and claimed asylum in February 2003.   His asylum claim was refused in September 2003, but he was granted exceptional leave to remain for six months. Kathem obtained a job as a machinist and started renting his own flat. His application for extension of leave was refused in August 2004, but notification sent to the wrong address. He only discovered this in 2007. He therefore had no legal entitlement to work and was forced to give up his job, and after exhausting his savings he eventually had no option but to quit his rented accommodation. He applied for section 4 support but was refused. By now destitute, he went to stay with a friend living in Birmingham.  Kathem attempted to leave the UK to make a fresh start in France, but he was arrested in Folkestone for using a false Romanian ID card. He was sentenced to one year in prison, and a deportation order was issued in May 2009. After serving six months, his prison sentence ended, but his detention was continued under immigration powers. He applied for bail, but this was refused at a hearing in April 2010.   Following a bail hearing in November 2010, one year after the end of his prison sentence, Kathem was released from detention and subsequently provided with section 4 support. He remains in limbo. Because of his conviction he is not eligible for regularisation under paragraph 395c of the Immigration Rules.  26. ERT recommends that the UK implements a maximum time limit for immigration detention of no more than six months. ERT also recommends that the UK does not subject stateless persons to immigration detention for purposes of removal.  27. ERT recis not arbitrary, and is only pursued as a necessary final resort that is proportionate to the administrative objective at hand.  28. ERT recommends that the UK draws from the ERT Guidelines on the Identification and Detention of Stateless Persons international law.35  Other human rights concerns 29. Stateless persons released from detention remain in a state of legal limbo and are subject to severe restrictions on their enjoyment of human rights. Without the right to work and with limited access to social support, some find themselves destitute, unable to access adequate health care and with barriers to the enjoyment of private and family life.  30. Nearly all stateless persons are excluded from mainstream benefits and employment. Those that have had asylum claims refused may be eligible for section 4 support.  Section 4 support amounts to little                                                  34 See Ibid., pp. 115-116, for the full case study. In the report the interviewee is referred to as Kathem but this is not his real name. 35 See above, note 25.   8  more than 50 per cent of standard income support.36 These lower payments are justified on the basis -37 however stateless persons may be in legal limbo for long stretches of time, running into several years. In addition, section 4 support often results in dispersal to different areas in the UK, which can impinge on the private and family lives of stateless persons who may have spent prolonged periods in the UK. To be eligible for section 4 support, failed asylum seekers must be destitute and be taking steps to leave the UK. This second step, in practice, means that they must apply for voluntary assisted return. This policy does not take sufficient account of the situation of stateless persons. In their study, UNHCR/Asylum Aid found that 28 of the 37 participants interviewed had experienced destitution.38  31.  In 2003, the Home Affairs Select Committee stated that where the removal of a failed asylum seeker is delayed through no fault of his own, it is morally unacceptable for him to be rendered destitute [...] We believe it is absurd to refuse leave to remain to people who for whatever reason cannot be removed. We recommend that such people be granted a temporary status which will allow them to 39   32. ERT therefore recommends that the UK at all times respects, protects and fulfils the human rights of stateless persons subject to its jurisdiction. ERT specifically recommends that stateless persons are allowed equal access to work, healthcare and education.                                                               36 British Red Cross, Not Gone, But Forgotten, June 2010, available at: http://www.redcross.org.uk/About-us/Our-advocacy-work/~/media/BritishRedCross/Documents/About%20us/Not%20gone%20but%20forgotten%20destitution%20report.ashx. 37 Still Human, Still Here, Submission to the UK, 42nd session, 4-22 May 2009, p. 2, available at: http://stillhumanstillhere.wordpress.com/resources/. 38 See above, note 13, pp.93102, for a more detailed examination of relevant issues. 39 Select Committee on Home Affairs, Fourth Report ""Summary of Conclusions and Recommendation, 2003, available at: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmhaff/654/65409.htm.

19,FT - Freedome from Torture,"1     21 November 2011    Dear OHCHR colleagues,  Please find attached a submission from Freedom from Torture for the forthcoming Universal Periodic Review of the United Kingdom, scheduled for the 13th UPR session in 2012.    Freedom from Torture (formerly the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture) is a UK-based human rights organisation and one of the worlds largest torture treatment centres. We are the only organisation in the UK dedicated solely to the care and treatment of survivors of torture and organised violence. Since our foundation 25 years ago, more than 50,000 people have been referred to us for rehabilitation and other forms of care and practical assistance. Our clinicians also use forensic methods to document physical and psychological evidence of torture via medico-legal reports which are used in connection with We have centres in London, Manchester, Newcastle, Birmingham and Glasgow. Our submission focuses on four areas:  The UKs domestic human rights architecture and access to justice;  Accountability for complicity in torture;  Torture survivors within the UKs asylum system; and  Poverty among torture survivors.  Please direct any inquiries relating to this submission to: Sonya Sceats Senior Policy and Advocacy Officer Freedom from Torture 111 Isledon Road London N7 7JW United Kingdom ssceats@freedomfromtorture.org Direct line: + 44 207 697 7766  2 1. Freedom from Torture is pleased to make this submission in connection with the second Universal Periodic Review of the United Kingdom. The UKs domestic human rights architecture and access to justice 2. Freedom from Torture is highly concerned that a debate about whether the UK needs a (new) Bill of Rights1 is driven by a political agenda within parts of government to repeal or amend the Human Rights Act 1998 as a means of curtailing the protection of human rights in the UK.  3. The Home Secretary made clear her desire to restrict the protections afforded by the Act during a recent speech in which she argued that the Human Rights Act has to go before announcing changes to the Immigration Rules designed to limit application of the right to respect for private and family life in the immigration context.2 Earlier this year she told Parliament that she finds it incredible that the Act may prevent deportations of terror suspects where there is a risk of torture on return.3   4. The Human Rights Act includes a highly innovative and internationally acclaimed mechanism for dividing up responsibility between Parliament, the executive and the courts for ensuring effective protection of human rights in the UK. Freedom from Torture is concerned that there is a political agenda to redefine these responsibilities with a view to diluting the role of the courts.   5. Recommendation 1: there must be no repeal or weakening in any way of the Human Rights Act. 6. A Bill to reform the legal aid system is currently passing through Parliament.4 We discuss our specific concerns with this Bill further below, however it is important to stress that, if enacted, this legislation would make it more difficult for people to claim their human rights by severely restricting access to legal advice for those who cannot afford to pay for it.  Accountability for complicity in torture 7. Very soon after the new Government was formed in 2010, Prime Minister David Cameron announced an inquiry into allegations that the UK was complicit in torture committed abroad in the context of the War on Terror. The Prime Minister acknowledged that the allegations were a stain on the UKs reputation as a country that believes in freedom, fairness and human rights and stated that the inquirys purpose was to clear this matter up once and for all.5 This announcement was                                                  1 Freedom from Torture considers that the Human Rights Act is a Bill of Rights because it satisfies the key features of a Bill of Rights: it is a legal instrument, binding on government, that enshrines a set of fundamental human rights and provides a right to redress for victims in the event of violations. 2 See the Home Secretary Theresa Mays speech to the Conservative Party conference on 4 October 2011. Available at: http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2011/10/04/theresa-may-speech-in-full.   3 Hansard. HC, 16 February 2011, col. 963. 4 The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill 2011. 5 Hansard. HC, 6 July 2010, col. 175-6.  3 warmly welcomed by Freedom from Torture and other human rights organisations which called for the inquiry to be prompt, independent, thorough, capable of leading to the identification and prosecution of persons responsible, and provide for public scrutiny and victim participation. 8. Despite detailed advice from lawyers acting for the survivors and from NGOs, the government agreed a protocol for the inquiry which is clearly non-compliant with human rights standards. Serious problems include a denial of meaningful participation to survivors and their legal representatives and a mechanism for dealing with evidence which gives the final say on disclosure to the government. As a consequence, the survivors have announced through their lawyers that they are boycotting the inquiry and ten leading human rights NGOs including Freedom from Torture have also announced that they will not participate.6 On 13 November 2011, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan Méndez, noted the inquirys limitations and warned that [a] less than open and transparent inquiry would only serve to cover up abuses and encourage recurrence.7  9. Recommendation 2: The protocol for the torture inquiry should be revised to ensure, among other things, meaningful participation of the survivors and that decisions on disclosure of evidence are taken by an independent mechanism. 10. The very serious allegations at the heart of this inquiry are a reminder that the UK must never be complacent about its international human rights obligations and that robust accountability mechanisms are needed. Freedom from Torture considers that this is an ideal moment for the UK to finally permit individuals to take complaints to the UN Committee against Torture so that there can be accountability at the international level for any future victims of torture involving the UK. Such a step would send a powerful signal about the UKs renewed commitment to the torture ban. 11. Recommendation 3: The UK should accept the Committee against Tortures recommendation to enter a declaration under Article 22 of the UN Convention against Torture accepting the competence of the Committee to hear individual complaints.  Torture survivors within the UKs asylum system 12. The vast majority of Freedom from Tortures clients are asylum seekers or refugees who have sought protection in the UK after torture in other countries. We receive approximately 2000 referrals each year for clinical services including forensic documentation of physical and psychological evidence of torture, a wide range of therapies and practical support. In our experience, difficulties associated with the asylum system are a major impediment to rehabilitation.  13. Failure to identify torture survivors at a sufficiently early stage of the asylum process is a serious problem. This happens for a number of reasons including difficulties for most survivors of disclosing their torture experiences and insufficient training for UK                                                  6 The other NGOs are The AIRE Centre, Amnesty International, British Irish RIGHTS WATCH, CagePrisoners, Human Rights Watch, JUSTICE, Liberty, REDRESS and Reprieve. 7 Torture inquiry: UNs Juan Mendez calls for openness. Available at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15711317   4 Border Agency staff and doctors within detention centres on how to identify survivors. 14. Where a survivor is not identified as such by the Agency, their asylum claim will not be assessed properly and may be refused, potentially resulting in detention and removal to the state where they were tortured. Special safeguards for torture survivors  including provision of accommodation nearby to specialist treatment facilities, a low frequency of reporting, and special interview techniques  are unlikely to be applied, and the survivor may not be referred to appropriate health and other services. 15. The Agency has recently launched a range of initiatives designed to improve early identification of torture survivors including major reforms to the asylum screening process aimed at encouraging early disclosure of torture through more private interviewing facilities and a more sensitive approach by screening officers. The Agency is actively engaging Freedom from Torture and other stakeholders in this work. 16. Like many human rights organisations, Freedom from Torture has serious concerns about the Detained Fast Track (DFT) system. This is an expedited system where the asylum seeker is detained while their claim is processed and is applied to cases which the Agency considers can be decided quickly. However, people are selected for this procedure during screening, a point at which few have had access to legal advice and when the Agency knows little about the nature of the asylum claim. Torture survivors are not supposed to be allocated to this system because of the complexity of their claims and the risk of retraumatisation, yet significant numbers are nonetheless routed in. Freedom from Torture receives an average of 25 referrals per month from the DFT and we accept roughly half of these. 17. The Agencys policy against inclusion of torture survivors in the DFT is not sufficiently robust. The Suitability Exclusion Criteria for the DFT specify that those with independent evidence of torture are unlikely to be suitable for the system. This requirement is irrational because the vast majority of survivors simply do not have such evidence at this stage  not least because very few will have had access to a legal advisor and so will not have been referred to us for a medico-legal report. Disclosure of torture is extremely difficult for most torture survivors and few will appreciate that independent evidence of their torture is required at this very early stage either for the purposes of establishing their protection claim or, more urgently, to avoid detention.   18. There are multiple other problems with the Detained Fast Track process including insufficient time for asylum seekers to prepare their case, inadequate legal advice, and poor quality decision-making.8                                                   8 UNHCR has noted major concerns with the quality of decision-making in the DFT. See for example, UNHCR, Quality Integration Project  Key Observations and Recommendations, August 2010 available at http://www.unhcr.org.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/First_Quality_Integration_Project_Report_Key_Findings_and_Rec_01.pdf. On problems with the DFT generally, see Human Rights Watch, Fast-Tracked Unfairness  Detention and Denial of Women Asylum Seekers in the UK (February 2010),  5 19. Recommendation 4: The Detained Fast Track system should be abolished. 20. Recommendation 5: In the meantime, the Suitability Exclusion Criteria for the Detained Fast Track system should be amended to clarify that those reasonably suspected of being torture survivors must not be routed into this system. 21. It is difficult to secure release of torture survivors who have been wrongly detained because safeguards designed to correct these mistakes are failing or have otherwise been eroded by the Agency. For example, a facility to escort suspected torture survivors to Freedom from Torture for the purposes of assessment was effectively ended in March 2009 and Rule 35 of the Detention Centre Rules requiring medical practitioners to notify the Agency of any detained person who (s)he is concerned may be a victim of torture is chronically dysfunctional and rarely leads to release, as a recent audit of the process by the Agency demonstrated.9 Following heavy criticism from Parliaments Home Affairs Committee and the commencement of legal proceedings, the Agency is now working with Freedom from Torture and other stakeholders to improve the Rule 35 system. 22. During the UKs first Universal Periodic Review in 2008, the UK rejected a recommendation to withdraw its reservations to Articles 22 and 37(c) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The UK has since withdrawn these reservations which we welcome.  23. However, there are still many concerns about the rights of asylum-seeking children. The government claims it has ended detention of children for immigration purposes. However, the reality is that, despite intensified efforts to ensure this is a last resort and for the shortest possible period of time, children within families are still being detained on arrival for up to 24 hours. They may also be detained prior to removal from the UK in new pre-departure accommodation which is still a secure facility. Special protections for torture surviving families in the new family returns process have been awaiting finalisation for many months now. 24. Recommendation 6: Immigration detention of children should be ended completely. 25. Freedom from Torture is particularly concerned about the UKs plans as part of the European Return Platform for Unaccompanied Minors to begin forcibly removing refused child asylum seekers to Afghanistan once they reach 16 years of age. We are also concerned about the lack of any independent mechanism for assessing reception conditions on return, including the availability of adequate rehabilitation services for torture survivors. 26. Recommendation 7: the UK should pull out of the European Return Platform for Unaccompanied Minors and continue to grant discretionary leave to child asylum seekers until they reach 18 years of age.                                                                                                                                                          and Detention Action, Fast Track to Despair  The unnecessary detention of asylum-seekers (May 2011). 9 http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/reports/detention-centre-rule-35-audit/det-centre-rule-35-audit?view=Binaryavailable at: http://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news-events/news/3436    6 27. Decision-making regarding asylum claims by torture survivors is poor and the appeal overturn rate for these cases is high.10 We are pleased to report that the Immigration Minister Damian Green accepted each of the recommendations directed to the Agency in our recent report on asylum appeals involving our medico-legal reports and the Agency has worked with us to strengthen its guidance and training for decision-makers on how to use expert medical evidence of torture when assessing an asylum claim. Both the guidance and training are being piloted currently with the involvement of Freedom from Torture. 28. Asylum claims involving torture are complex and survivors require access to specialist legal advice to ensure their claims are properly prepared. Torture survivors in the UK are now struggling to access quality advice following the collapse of the two major providers, Refugee and Migrant Justice and the Immigration Advisory Service, as a result of difficulties connected with the legal aid system. Further reforms being considered by Parliament would preserve legal aid for asylum claims, but remove it for most immigration matters and Freedom from Torture is worried that this will drive further providers from the asylum advice market. 29. Recommendation 8: the legal aid system for asylum and immigration cases must be strengthened to ensure it is viable for quality advice providers. Poverty among torture survivors 30. Freedom from Torture is currently conducting a major study of poverty amongst torture survivors in the UK with a particular focus on the impact of poverty on the capacity of survivors to rehabilitate following their torture experiences. Early findings from this project suggest that torture survivors in the UK experience high levels of poverty due to a range of factors including:   Torture survivors are often wrongly denied mainstream support to which they are entitled because their needs, particularly their mental health needs, and their vulnerability are not properly assessed;    A ban on working for the first year in which an asylum claim is pending and restrictions on the right to work thereafter;   Incorrect decisions to deny asylum support and poor administration of this system including delays leading to destitution;  Inadequate levels of asylum support so that most asylum seekers are forced to survive on a level of support which is insufficient to meet essential living needs;11  Accommodation that is inadequate and/or inappropriate for reasons including pest infestations, dampness, poor security, and, for survivors of torture suffering                                                  10 See Freedom from Torture, Body of Evidence  Treatment of Medico-Legal Reports for Survivors of Torture in the UK Asylum Tribunal (May 2011). For the sample of 37 cases in this study, the appeal overturn rate was 49%, a figure which climbed to 69% for those cases in which the UK Border Agency had access to our medico-legal report at the initial decision stage.  11 See the submission relating to the second Universal Periodic Review of the UK from the Still Human Still Here coalition. Freedom from Torture is a member of this coalition.  7 sleep disturbance and traumatic flashbacks, sharing a bedroom with strangers;   Ineligibility for support of many who have been refused protection but are unable to return to their country of origin through no fault of their own, resulting in destitution;   Difficulties accessing primary and secondary healthcare including because of misunderstandings by practitioners about entitlements and an entitlement gap for some refused asylum seekers in relation to secondary healthcare; and  Diminishing sources of support in the voluntary sector as a consequence of the economic downturn. 31. Recommendation 9: The UK should accept the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommendation to remove restrictions on access by asylum seekers to the labour market while their claims for asylum are being processed. 32. Recommendation 10:  Asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute should be provided with cash support equivalent to no less than 70% of mainstream income support levels until they have been given status in the UK or been returned to their country of origin. 33. Recommendation 11: Processes for assessing entitlement to mainstream benefits such as Employment Support Allowance should be reviewed to ensure that serious mental health difficulties, including those associated with trauma, are properly taken into account. 34. Recommendation 12: All asylum seekers, including all refused asylum seekers, in the UK should have free access to primary and secondary healthcare. 35. Freedom from Torture is particularly worried about plans to cut legal aid for advice about welfare entitlements at a time when the welfare system is being radically overhauled and when increasing numbers of people are turning to it because of the economic downturn. Access to legal aid in this area is particularly important for torture survivors given difficulties they face in accessing their entitlements as they transition from the asylum system to mainstream benefits. 36. Recommendation 13: Legal aid must remain available for advice about welfare entitlements. 37. Failure by the government to give full legal effect in domestic law to the rights contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) is a major challenge when seeking to promote socio-economic rights in the UK.   38. Recommendation 14: The UK should accept the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommendation to incorporate into domestic law the rights protected by the ICESCR.

About Dover Detainee Visitor Group  DDVG works to ease the consequences of indefinite immigration detention, destitution of ex-detainees and to challenge attitudes towards immigrants in the UK. Our mission is to provide emotional and practical support to immigration detainees held at the Dover Immigration Removal Centre, ease the effects of destitution on ex-detainees who are released into the community and facilitate their integration (nationwide), and to raise awareness about immigration and indefinite detention in the UK.   Summary  1. This submission relates to the difficulties facing immigration detainees in the UK detention estate in regards to obtaining good quality legal advice and representation in order to effectively challenge their detention, and how this impacts on Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to liberty and security. While Article 5 does of course allow for states to deprive the individual of their liberty for the purposes of immigration control, this is only allowed in accordance with the law. British law stipulates that detention should be used as a last resort and for the shortest time possible, and that legal safeguards are in place so that detainees are able to challenge their detention. This is only possible if there is a system of good quality legal advice and representation being accessible, otherwise there is a risk that detention may not be challenged effectively and may breach Article 5. This is particularly relevant when you consider that most detainees are not native English speakers, and will not be familiar with the intricacies of British immigration law or the system that holds them. We believe that there are significant problems in this area, and that the Border Agency are making poor decisions around detaining or prolonging    GATWICK DETAINEES WELFARE GROUP  Patrons: Lord Dholakia OBE, Baroness Williams of Crosby Registered charity No. 1124328 Company Limited by Guarantee No. 4911257   The Orchard, 1-2 Gleneagles Court, Brighton Road, Crawley, RH10 6AD Tel. 01293 657070 Fax. 01293 474001 www.gdwg.org.uk info@gdwg.org.uk      the detention of many people, and that they are being detained without access to adequate legal advice, therefore prolonging their detention, even in circumstances where it may be unlawful.    The current situation in the UK  2. The British government recently disclosed that it had spent more than £12 million pounds on compensation claims for unlawful detention during 2009-101. Amongst those compensated were torture survivors and other vulnerable detainees who were were held for prolonged periods of months and years, where removal could not be considered imminent, or in many cases even possible. While it is unclear how many people were actually paid compensation, it does seem apparent that the breaching of  (IRCs), but that it is a relatively widespread occurrence. The experience of the Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group, as well as a number of other detention-related NGOs that we work with, is that the problem is getting worse. The UK government currently detains more than 25,000 people each year, with more than 2,500 detained on average at any one time2. We have identified a number of detainees over the past few years who we believed to be unlawfully detained, and who we were able to refer to lawyers who specialise in this area of work. However, there were many occasions where we were unable to find a lawyer, not because of a lack of merit in the case, but due to a lack of capacity at the firms in question, and a lack of good quality lawyers overall.  3. The problem of the dwindling numbers of good quality Legal Aid lawyers has been compounded in recent years with the collapse into administration of the two biggest providers of legal advice to asylum seekers and other migrants in the last eighteen months or so, Refugee and Migrant Justice (June 2010) and the Immigration Advisory Service (July 2011), with both blaming changes in Legal Aid and the restructuring of payments brought in by the Justice Department3. This has had a huge impact on many detainees, leaving them without representation, and hence reducing their chances of challenging their detention effectively.   4. For those held in detention now, a system of exclusive contracts has led to restrictions on their choice of advice providers, meaning only a limited number of firms with Legal Aid contracts are able to go in to each IRC to give 30 minute advice sessions and take                                                  1 Baroness Neville-Jones, Minister of State, Home Office, Hansard 29 Nov 2010 : Column WA410 2 http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/immigration-asylum-research/immigration-brief-q2-2011/detention  3 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14105065, 11th July 2011    GATWICK DETAINEES WELFARE GROUP  Patrons: Lord Dholakia OBE, Baroness Williams of Crosby Registered charity No. 1124328 Company Limited by Guarantee No. 4911257   The Orchard, 1-2 Gleneagles Court, Brighton Road, Crawley, RH10 6AD Tel. 01293 657070 Fax. 01293 474001 www.gdwg.org.uk info@gdwg.org.uk      on new clients. During those 30 minutes, representatives from legal firms are under obligation not only to advise the client, but also to take on cases where there are sufficient merits. Firms are also obliged to have enough resources and manpower to take all clients seen during those sessions, provided the clients have enough merit. In practice, this often does not happen. Some firms have told visitor groups, off the record, that out of ten clients seen at a surgery, they can only take two. A 30 minute session is not enough time to fully assess the merits of a case, be it for their substantive appeal, detention matter or bail. Many of our clients have informed us that they have routinely been told during these Detention Duty Advice (DDA) appointments therefore the provider would not be assisting them at all. This advice completely ignores the fact that their substantive immigration matter and the matter of their detention should be considered separately, and while a detainee may not qualify for Legal Aid on their substantive matter, all detainees should be entitled to advice and possible representation for a bail hearing in order to challenge their detention. In many cases this is not happening, leading to many detainees being forced to apply for bail on their own, which significantly reduces the chance of success4.  5. GDWG have also encountered many detainees who did not even know about the existence of the DDA surgeries, despite some of them being in detention for prolonged periods. For example, we spoke to a man from Ivory Coast recently who had been in Brook House IRC at Gatwick for 13 months, but knew nothing about the advice surgeries that took place there. It seems that there is a general lack of information provided to detainees about the scheme in Brook House, and indeed many other removal centres. Bail for Immigration Detainees and the Information Centre about Asylum Seekers and Refugees found that only 42% of detainees they surveyed from all 11 IRCs in the UK had heard of the DDA scheme5.   Case Study  6. Below is a case study, compiled by our colleagues at the Dover Detainee Visitor Group (DDVG), of a client who experienced the previously described problems with the DDA6:  Ahmed  An obvious case for bail turned down                                                   4 Close Campsfield Campaign, Immigration Bail Hearings: A Travesty of Justice?, March 2011 5 'Provisional results of a survey of levels of legal representation for immigration detainees across the UK detention estate , June 2011, Bail for Immigration Detainees & Information Centre about Asylum and Refugees 6 Report on the DDA Legal Surgeries at Dover IRC, Dover Detainee Visitor Group, September 2011    GATWICK DETAINEES WELFARE GROUP  Patrons: Lord Dholakia OBE, Baroness Williams of Crosby Registered charity No. 1124328 Company Limited by Guarantee No. 4911257   The Orchard, 1-2 Gleneagles Court, Brighton Road, Crawley, RH10 6AD Tel. 01293 657070 Fax. 01293 474001 www.gdwg.org.uk info@gdwg.org.uk      7. Ahmed had removal directions set for 21/6/11 via a chartered flight to Baghdad, Iraq. This flight was cancelled after an injunction based on Human Rights Article 3. Ahmed was kept in detention anyway while most of the people scheduled to be removed on that flight were released.  8. He booked an appointment through the DDA legal surgeries at Dover IRC. He met someone from a DDA firm on the 28/06/11. He explained to the solicitor that he needed legal representation and that he wanted to be represented for Temporary Admission and/or bail since he was one of the Iraqis on that cancelled flight. Clearly he could not have been removed from the UK within a reasonable time and the case of this chartered flight was widely publicised among all those working with/for detained people. However, the solicitor informed him that the firm could not represent him and that the solicitor present for that meeting was not there to look into the merits of his case, or to represent him, or to apply for bail. He was there simply to give him some advice. He also advised Ahmed to talk to Bail for Immigration Detainees (a charity who help detainees apply for bail) for representation for bail.  9. A caseworker from DDVG met Ahmed on the same day that Ahmed met this solicitor. When Ahmed told him what was said to him by this solicitor, the caseworker from DDVG approached the solicitor in question (who was still giving advice to other detained clients) in case there was a misunderstanding. The solicitor repeated that he was not there to take on cases and that he was there to give some advice, nothing more.  10. Ahmed sent a formal complaint explaining that he was under the impression that these legal surgeries were there for detainees to find legal representation if they had sufficient merit. Ahmed also wrote that he thought that if a detainee had enough merit, then the solicitor firm was under the obligation to take on that case.  11. The following i   no papers low. Dover.  s they had limited instructions and were not in a position to take on his substantive application. This is in direct contravention to the rules laid down by the LSC, which state that firms have to consider separately whether there are merits to apply for bail. may, not must, pursue cases with merit if they had sufficient resources and if they had been allocated enough New Matters Starts (NMS) at Dover. Again, this is    GATWICK DETAINEES WELFARE GROUP  Patrons: Lord Dholakia OBE, Baroness Williams of Crosby Registered charity No. 1124328 Company Limited by Guarantee No. 4911257   The Orchard, 1-2 Gleneagles Court, Brighton Road, Crawley, RH10 6AD Tel. 01293 657070 Fax. 01293 474001 www.gdwg.org.uk info@gdwg.org.uk      contrary to the LSC rules, which allow firms to increase their NMS awards, and also stipulate that firms must have the capacity to provide further advice/representation to all clients who qualify on means/merits. ue the client with a CW4 appeal form as they should have done.  Observations  12. In this case it seems that this firm violated a number of points from the Standard Civil Contract for DDA Firms and it seems that the person who met Ahmed was completely unaware of his role at the legal surgery.   13. By setting a maximum number of NMS awards, law firms might get the impression that there is no obligation to take on cases once they have used their NMS. We believe the LSC should make it clear that law firms are under obligation to take on cases with merit, and should therefore either provide them with more NMS in the first place or make them aware of their obligation to request more NMS if the need arises. We find it shocking that in 75% of the cases during an initial DDA pilot run by the LSC, DDA firms were able to determine in 30 minute meetings with no interpreters present that those cases clearly had no merit. We would like to point out that cases where merit is unclear should be taken on for further investigation.    Conclusion and Recommendations  14. The system of immigration detention in the UK is, in our opinion, fundamentally flawed, and this is leading to an increasing number of people being detained in breach of Article 5 of the ECHR. Primarily this situation is caused by the Border Agency making poor and in many cases unlawful decisions about who to detain and for how long, and this is exacerbated by the problems of finding good quality legal advisors to assist detainees in challenging their detention. Further Legal Aid cuts threaten to make this problem even worse, leaving even more detainees unrepresented and unable to navigate their way through the legal minefield they are faced with. We would like to see not only better decision-making by the Border Agency, but also better provision of legal advice and representation to detainees so that they may effectively challenge their ongoing detention.  15. GDWG recommend the following:  Recommendation 1: There should be an automatic right to free legal representation for bail applications. Detainees should be able to easily access good quality legal advice and representation from reputable firms in order to apply for bail.

Detainees should once again be allowed more freedom of choice over where they can get publicly funded legal advice and representation.  Recommendation 3: Immigration work should be protected against the proposed Legal Aid cuts. has a profound effect on their detention, meaning that if they are unable to access free legal representation for appeals against deportation or immigration applications, they are much less likely to succeed in any application for release from detention.

21,GIEACPC - Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children,"1   UNITED KINGDOM  BRIEFING FOR THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW  13th session, 2012 From Peter Newell, Coordinator, Global Initiative, info@endcorporalpunishment.org   Corporal punishment of children breaches their rights to respect for human dignity and physical integrity and to equal protection under the law. It is recognised by the Committee on the Rights of the  Study on Violence against prevention of all forms of violence. In June 2006, the Committee on the Rights of the Child adopted General Comment No. 8 of the child to protection from corporal punishment and other cruel or degrading forms of punishment of children, including within the home. Other treaty bodies and also regional human rights mechanisms have condemned all corporal punishment. In October 2006, the report of the UN recommends universal prohibition of all corporal punishment as a matter of priority. The Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children has regularly briefed the Committee on the Rights of the Child on this issue since 2002, since 2004 has similarly briefed the Committee Against Torture, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Human Rights Committee, and in 2011 began briefing the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. There is growing progress across all regions in challenging this common form of violence against children. But many States persist in ignoring treaty body recommendations to prohibit and eliminate all corporal punishment. We hope the Working Group of the UPR the concluding observations from treaty bodies on this issue, as well as to the recommendations made during the first cycle of the UPR.  Corporal punishment of children is lawful in the UK and its Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, despite repeated recommendations made by human rights treaty bodies and during the review of the UK by the Human Rights Council in the first cycle of the UPR. We hope the Human Rights ignoring treaty body recommendations and strongly recommend that legislation be introduced as a matter of urgency to prohibit corporal punishment of children in the home and in all settings throughout the UK and its Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories, including through fully repealing all legal defences for its use.      2   1 The initial review of the UK by the Human Rights Council 1.1 The UK was reviewed in the first cycle of the Universal Periodic Review in 2008 (session 1). The issue of corporal punishment was raised in advance questions by Finland, Italy and Sweden, and the following recommendations were made during the review: iolence against children, including corporal punishment. (Italy) children. (Sweden) n 1 1.2 The Government stated that it sees no need for law reform since it believes the current law is working well, parents should be allowed to discipline children and surveys show that the use of corporal punishment in childrearing has declined.2 It accepted the recognition to consider going beyond current legislation in relation to protecting children from violence but rejected lication of its policy on corporal 3 The mid-term report, dated March 2010, repeats this assertion and draws attention to the prohibition of corporal punishment in education and care settings and to the review being undertaken of corporal punishment in some education settings which fall outside of the legal framework.4 The report refers to previous law reforms which limited the cases of assault occasioning cruelty or actual or grievous bodily harm. However, it then attempts to defend the continued legality of a certain degree of physical punishment in not want to c: the Government considers the promotion of positive discipline techniques to be sufficient to address the issue. 1.3 In sum, the legality of corporal punishment of children in the UK has not changed since the review in 2008. While it is prohibited in schools, the penal system and some alternative care settings, it continues to be lawful in the home and in some forms of care. Section 2 below provides details of the legality of corporal punishment in all settings in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and in the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories.  2 Legality of corporal punishment in the UK 2.1 Corporal punishment is lawful in the home. In England and Wales, section 58 of the                                                  1 23 May 2008, A/HRC/8/25, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, paras. 56(2), 56(3), 56(4) and 56(5) 2 23 May 2008, A/HRC/8/25, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, para. 25 3 25 August 2008, A/HRC/8/25/Add.1, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Addendum: Views on conclusions and/or recommendations, voluntary commitments and replies presented by the State under review, paras. 28, 29 and 30 4 United Kingdom Mission to the Office of the United Nations and Other International Organisations at Geneva, Human Rights Council 13th session Universal Periodic Review, Mid-term progress update by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on its implementation of recommendations agreed in June 2008, para. 7  3  article 2 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order (2006) ildren is lawful under section 51 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act (2003), defining blows to the head, shaking and use of implements as unjustifiable. Corporal punishment is lawful in the home in the Crown Dependencies and in the Overseas Territories under the common law right to prohibited in section 7 of the Children Ordinance (2003). 2.2 Numerous studies have revealed the extent to which children are physically punished in Council in 2008. For example, in large scale research carried out by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) in 2009 and published in 2011, 41.6% of the parents/ the past year.5 In a survey of 1,000 parents of children aged 0-10 in Northern Ireland, 47% said they had physically punished their children at some point and 45% had done so in the last year, most commonly smacking their child with a bare hand but 2.2% had hit their child with an implement.6 2.3 Corporal punishment was prohibited in all state schools in the UK in 1986. The prohibition was extended to cover private schools in England and Wales in 1998, in Scotland in 2000, and in Northern Ireland in 2003. However, it is not prohibited in schools in the majority of the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories, including Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey, Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos Islands. 2.4 In the penal system, corporal punishment is unlawful as a sentence for crime throughout the UK and the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories. It is unlawful as a disciplinary measure in all penal institutions except in Gibraltar, the Isle of Man and Montserrat. 2.3 With regard to alternative care settings, corporal punishment is prohibited by regulation in residential care Residential Establishments Child Care (Scotland) Regulations, 1996). It is prohibited in foster care arranged by local authorities or voluntary organisations but is lawful in private foster care. In day care institutions and childminding, it is prohibited by regulations issued in 2002 for Wales and Scotland and in 2003 for England (Day Care and Child Minding (National Standards) (England) Regulations 2003, SI 2003/1996). Guidance states that physical punishment should not be used in day care institutions and childminding in Northern Ireland, but there is no explicit prohibition in law. There is no prohibition of corporal punishment in care settings in the Crown Dependencies and the Overseas Territories except in the Pitcairn Islands (see above).  3 Recommendations by human rights treaty monitoring bodies 3.1 The Committee on the Rights of the Child has recommended three times that the UK prohibit corporal punishment of children  in 2008 in its concluding observations on the state 7 in 2002 on the second report8 and in 1995 on the initial report.9 In                                                  5 Radford, L. et al (2011), Child abuse and neglect in the UK today, London: NSPCC 6 Bunting, L., Webb, M.

UK prohibit corporal punishment of children in the home  in 2002 following examination 10 and again in 2009 in its concluding observations on the fifth report.11 3.3 In 2008, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women expressed concern at corporal punishment of children in the home and recommended prohibition in legislation.12 3.4 In 2008, the Human Rights Committee recommended prohibition of corporal punishment in schools in all Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies.13 3.5 In 2005, the European Committee of Social Rights concluded that the situation in the UK is not in conformity with article 17 of the European Social Charter because corporal punishment in the home is not prohibited.14  Briefing prepared by the Global Initiative to End All Corporal

22,HLPR - Howard League Penal Reform,"President: The Lord Carlile of Berriew QC  Chair: Sue Wade  Director: Frances Crook  Charity No. 251926 Company limited by guarantee No. 898514  The Howard League for Penal Reform works for a safe society where fewer people are victims of crime The Howard League for Penal Reform believes that community sentences make a person take responsibility and live a law-abiding life in the community The Howard League for Penal Reform believes that offenders must make amends for what they have done and change their lives      United Kingdom Universal Periodic Review Submission by the Howard League for Penal Reform  October 2011  The Howard League for Penal Reform is the leading non-governmental organisation dealing with penal reform in the United Kingdom and was awarded special consultative status with the United Nations in 1947. It is an independent charity and accepts no funding from government.   The Howard League for Penal Reform has the following values statement:    The Howard League for Penal Reform works for a safe society where fewer people are victims of crime    The Howard League for Penal Reform believes that offenders must make amends for what they have done and change their lives    The Howard League for Penal Reform believes that community sentences make a person take responsibility and live a law-abiding life in the community.   The Howard League for Penal Reform welcomes the opportunity to contribute towards the upcoming United Kingdom Universal Periodic Review. We have chosen to focus on a number of key issues which are in violation of the human rights framework and fall below the standards expected of a developed nation. In addition to these key points we also note that the UK has a substandard and unjust penal system which flouts much of the guidance outlined in the United Nations standards in the treatment of prisoners (1955).  Indeterminate prison sentences   Breach of proportionality and the independence of the judiciary   The Howard League for Penal Reform has calculated that England and Wales currently has more people incarcerated on indeterminate prison sentences than all the other 46 countries in the Council of Europe combined. The expansion of mandatory open ended sentences is a clear breach of proportionality and the principle that punishment should be based on the crime committed, rather than risk of future criminality. The use of mandatory sentences also fetters the discretion of the judiciary, yet they are applied to the most serious and violent crimes where the stakes are at their most high.   Over 14,000 men and women are serving an indeterminate sentence in England and Wales and until our sentencing framework has been reformed we will continue to condemn hundreds of people each year to an uncertain and unjust future.   Breaches of Articles 7 and 9 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights  The number of people serving an indeterminate sentence dramatically increased following the implementation of the Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentence in 2005. Whilst the IPP sentence has now been recognised as flawed on many levels, its impact is still evident  there are currently around 6,550 men and women serving an IPP sentence and over half of them are being detained past their tariff with no realistic prospect for release.   President: The Lord Carlile of Berriew QC  Chair: Sue Wade  Director: Frances Crook  Charity No. 251926 Company limited by guarantee No. 898514  The Howard League for Penal Reform works for a safe society where fewer people are victims of crime The Howard League for Penal Reform believes that community sentences make a person take responsibility and live a law-abiding life in the community The Howard League for Penal Reform believes that offenders must make amends for what they have done and change their lives  The Ministry of Justice has recently announced that the IPP sentence will be abolished. However this will not be retrospective and the backlog of prisoners will continue to be held until the prison service is able to provide the courses that will allow them to demonstrate eligibility for release. The financial and logistical constraints within the prison service means that in practice those serving an IPP cannot progress through their sentence and the UK is therefore in violation of Article 7 of the Declaration as their detention is arbitrary and indiscriminate. In addition to problems facing the general IPP population, those with learning disabilities who do not meet the minimum threshold for education have no prospect of completing their sentence plan. Discrimination on such grounds is a further breach of Article 9 of the Declaration. Whilst the Howard League welcomes the announcement that the IPP sentence will be removed we are concerned that the failure to make any new provision retrospective means that the many thousands of men and women on this sentence will continue to be detained in prison with no clarity about the length of their imprisonment.  Children in the criminal justice system  Breach of Article 37(b), UN Convention on the Rights of the Child   The Howard League has a history of campaigning vulnerable children, particularly where they have breached their obligation to only use arrest, detention or imprisonment as a last resort or for the shortest possible time. Following the ResoluHuman rights in the administration of justice, in particular juvenile justicewas passed in September this year, the UK is also disregarding many of the recommendations regarding children.   In England and Wales the age of criminal responsibility is 10 whilst in both Northern Ireland and Scotland moves are being made to increase their minimum age to 12. This low age of criminal responsibility means that many children whose behaviour should be dealt with by parents or in extreme cases of vulncriminalised. Research conducted by the Howard League for Penal Reform recently found that at least a quarter of a million children are arrested every year. Consequently, the UK has one of the largest youth justice systems in Europe.   Breach of Article 3, UN Convention on the Rights of the Child  The use of penal custody for children as young as 10 contravenes our obligations under international law. Once a child has been criminalised, their best interests are no longer prioritised and this remains a clear breach of article 3 of the convention on the rights of the child. The UK uses child custody excessively; over 5,000 children were imprisoned in 2010 and at any one time almost 2,500 children are held in custody (YJB/MoJ 2011). Of those children, around 80 per cent are held in Young Offender Institutions, the most punitive and basic provision available.   Breach of Articles 6, 19 and 37(a/c), UN Convention on the Rights of the Child  The Howard League has raised concerns about further breaches of the rights of the child, in regards to the use of restraint, solitary confinement and forcible strip-searching of children in custody. An investigation by Lord Carlile QC concluded that using these methods with children in custody would be unlawful in any other context (The Howard League, 2006). His report revealed that the use of force on children is endemic in prisons and privately run secure training centres.       President: The Lord Carlile of Berriew QC  Chair: Sue Wade  Director: Frances Crook  Charity No. 251926 Company limited by guarantee No. 898514  The Howard League for Penal Reform works for a safe society where fewer people are victims of crime The Howard League for Penal Reform believes that community sentences make a person take responsibility and live a law-abiding life in the community The Howard League for Penal Reform believes that offenders must make amends for what they have done and change their lives Women in the criminal justice system    Breach of Article 2, UN Convention on the Elimination of all forms of discrimination against women  Cross party policy has recognised that female imprisonment is unjust, ineffective and has a catastrophic impact on women (APPG, 2011). The prison service was built to house men, and it does not meet the needs of the vulnerable and damaged female population. Despite its impropriety, the UK continues to imprison women excessively and impose disproportionately punitive sentences in comparison to men. More than half of women entering prison do so on remand and of that number 60 per cent do not then receive a custodial sentence. In addition, the number of women serving short sentences or who are recalled to prison has increased disproportionately in the past year.    The Howard League recommends that women are diverted from custody into supportive, effective centres that get to the heart of offending behaviour. Only when dealing with dangerous and violent women should custody be imposed, and in these cases they should be held in small, secure, local units instead of traditional prison institutions.   Breach of Article 3, UN Convention on the Rights of the Child  The excessive imprisonment of women not only contravenes the rights of female prisoners, but also the rights of their children whose wellbeing should always be considered when sentencing. The Howard  (2011) at the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child Day of General Discussion on prisonerschildren. Our research found that more than 17,000 children are separated from their mother every year through imprisonment, causing long term emotional, social, material and psychological damage and subsequent breaches of other human rights safe guards designed to protect the child and family.  If sentencing reform was introduced ensuring community sentences were prioritised over imprisonment, thousands of children could be spared the agony of separation and their mothers could address their own needs in a community based environment.  Recommendations   The removal of all mandatory indeterminate sentences which should be replaced by a sentence which reinstates judicial discretion   An increase in the age of criminal responsibility from ten to fourteen  A commitment from the UK that no child will be sent to a young offender institution and   Sentencing guidelines that promote community sentences for all women, except in the most serious cases           President: The Lord Carlile of Berriew QC  Chair: Sue Wade  Director: Frances Crook  Charity No. 251926 Company limited by guarantee No. 898514  The Howard League for Penal Reform works for a safe society where fewer people are victims of crime The Howard League for Penal Reform believes that community sentences make a person take responsibility and live a law-abiding life in the community The Howard League for Penal Reform believes that offenders must make amends for what they have done and change their lives  References   An independent inquiry into the use of physical restraint, solitary confinement and forcible strip searching of children in prisons, secure training homes (2006) Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, published by The Howard League for Penal Reform, London.

23,HRCS - Human Rights Consortium Scotland,"1                   Universal Periodic Review of UK: A civil society perspective from Scotland on human rights promotion, delivery and compliance       21st November 2011      C/o Glasgow Disability Alliance Suite 301, Building 4, Templeton Business Centre, 62 Templeton Street, Glasgow G40 1DA Tel: 0141 556 7103 Fax: 0141 550 4937 Contact: Shirley Bradley shirleybradley@gdaonline.co.uk Web: www.gdaonline.co.uk Human Rights Consortium Scotland  2   The Government is, of course, to be commended for introducing the Human Rights Act; but too often subsequently there has been a lack of leadership to use the Act to its full potential, ensure that public bodies promote human rights as well as do the 1 Introduction The Human Rights Consortium Scotland (HRCS) is pleased to have the opportunity to its international human rights obligations. The (HRCS) was set up in January 2010 and is a network of 37 civil society organisations working to increase awareness of human rights and to build capacity on delivering human rights principles and Members cover issues such as poverty, discrimination, combating violence and members work with specific as well as general groups of people such as children, women and national minorities.  Members include the Campaign for Freedom of Information in Scotland, Migrants Rights Scotland, Inclusion Scotland, Engender and the Coalition for Racial Equality and Rights.   We have no resources but benefit from the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) providing meeting accommodation and catering, and Glasgow Disability Alliance providing administrative support.    The establishment of the HRCS was a reaction to the absence of an NGO that is focused on general human rights compliance and promotion across Scotland.  The Scottish Human Rights Centre (formerly Scottish Council for Civil Liberties established in 1968) closed in 2005 and Human Rights Scotland closed in 2007.  Amnesty International Scotland, with its global remit does undertake some work on the domestic application of human rights e.g. important work on the Taser pilot by Strathclyde Police and important work on gypsy travellers as well as undertaking educational work in schools across Scotland.  Given our scarce resources this submission is a composite of some of the areas we have already expressed concern about and we recognise that matters may change given the timeframe for the review.  We believe each issue can be addressed through a dialogue with the UN, a willingness to work in partnership, agreeing priorities and drawing on best practice in other countries. We believe that the cultural, policy and organisational barriers to explicit compliance with human rights standards in Scotland are capable of easy and prompt remedy by informed and committed leaders in political, public and civic life.     Furthermore, we believe that the human rights treaties ratified so far set specific duties that can be generally applied by our Government and public sector.   For example Article 31 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires cluding statistical and research data, to enable them to formulate and implement policies to give effect   The systematic gathering of data on human rights                                             1 House of Commons House of Lords Joint Committee on Human Rights Para 20, Report 2010     3  compliance and its regular publication would certainly assist us to come to a better understanding of human rights across Scotland. Purpose of Submission from HRCS The HRCS now seeks to highlight key issues in Scotland that should be addressed.  s on our resources and on the length of this document.  We are deliberately focusing on where improvements can be made.  However at the outset we wish to state that we welcome the leadership on a range of recent matters such as the puSeptember 2009 and understand that delivery may fall short of expectation but that there is a will to improve.  We also welcome the opportunity to work e.g. with the new Human Rights Policy Manager at Scottish Government.  In the past the Scottish Government has been helpful e.g. agreeing that civil society can use its video conferencing facilities so that we can participate in a Ministry of Justice meeting in London.  The HRCS seeks to work in partnership with the Scottish Government to improve the delivery of human rights across Scotland.  Human Rights Law in Scotland Devolved Government In 1707, the Scottish Parliament was suspended and was reconvened in 1999.   The Scottish Parliament, made up of 129 elected MSPs, and our Scottish Government have the power to pass laws, agree policies and fund services that are human rights compliant.  In examining the UK, we urge the UN to establish just what distinct progress has been made in Scotland given the fantastic opportunity of a new form of public sector bodies and civil society to mainstream human rights across all aspects of our lives.  The powers devolved to the Scottish Parliament are framed by what they cannot do rather than defining what they can.  That means the Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament do have the power to act on a range of issues such as health, housing, education and local authority functions such as social work.  Progress to date on specific human rights measures has however been patchy.  Scotland Act 1998  The Scotland Act established the Scottish Parliament.  The Act was passed by the UK parliament in 1998.  The Act defines Scottish legislation as being competent if it meets certain tests including that it is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights (S29)   Section 57 of the Act requires all actions of Scottish Government Ministers (described as Scottish Executive Ministers) to comply with the ain actions of the Lord Advocate (S57(3) which relate to the prosecution of crime and investigation of deaths).   If Scottish Ministers fail to meet these obligations 2 they may be subject to enforcement action against them on the part of the UK Secretary of State by virtue of section 58 of the Scotland Act. Arguably the Scotland Act embodies a legitimate expectation that the actions of the Scottish devolved institutions will be compatible with the UK's international obligations when you also add in the definition of human rights  - Schedule 5 7 (2) (a) and S126(10).                                              2 Section 58(1)  4  When the Scottish Parliament was permitted to define human rights, it went beyond the ECHR and looked to include international human rights treaties:  The Scottish Commission for Human Rights Act 2006 requires the Scottish Human Rights Commission (SHRC) to promote and encourage best practice in relation to human rights which are defined as ECHR as well as other human rights contained in a ratified, international treaty - Section 2(2) (b)  The Commissioner for Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2003 gives specific responsibilities to Young People (SCCYP) to have regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in all its work - Section 5  Questions 1. Will the UN ask the Scottish Government how it defines its human rights obligations in respect of UN treaties?   2. What explicit evidence it can cite to demonstrate how it gives effect to those obligations e.g. across the seven ratified Treaties as well as the Universal Declaration on Human Rights?   3. In terms of the regulatory framework established in Scotland to ensure that public services spend money wisely and deliver on their functions, how are human rights factored into that regulatory process?  For example how does Audit Scotland ensure that human rights are being delivered across the health boards, local authorities and other public bodies for which it is responsible?  Concerns 1. Failure to incorporate ratified UN Treaties and need for legal clarity The HRCS is concerned about the failure to address the real problem which is the lack of explicit compliance with international human rights law across the UK and believe the UK Government should focus on making the equal enjoyment of human rights a reality for ordinary people across the UK.   The UN has repeatedly advised the UK to incorporate the seven ratified UN Treaties into domestic law and the HRCS agrees.   For example in 2009 the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stated: effect in its domestic law, that the Covenant rights are made justiciable, and that effective remedies are available for victims of all violations of economic, social and cultural rights.  The Committee reiterates its recommendation that, irrespective of the system through which international law is incorporated in the domestic legal order (monism or dualism), following ratification of an international instrument, the State party is under a legal obligation to comply with such an instrument and to give it full effect in its domestic legal order. In this respect, the Committee again draws the attention of the State party to its General Comment No. 9 (1998) on the domestic application of the Covenant3   The Committee was also concerned about the absence of a national action plan on human rights (Paras 12 and 14), a concern which the HRCS shares.   We are                                             3 Para 13 Concluding Observations on UK E/C.12/GBR/CO/5 22nd May 2009   5  but argue this approach can be replicated in the other six treaties.  Proposed Questions 1. When will Scotland incorporate the seven ratified UN Treaties? 2. Can you ask the Scottish Government when it will replicate adopting an ding Observations of the other six UN treaties?   3. If they agree on such a strategy, what is the time frame and who will be involved in the process of agreeing the action plans?   4. If such plans are drafted, what specific responsibilities will be expected from the public sector (such as local authorities and health boards) to make sure the plans are delivered across Scotland?   5. What will be the monitoring and accountability processes?  2. Lack of evidence on explicit compliance with human rights law and duties Two studies undertaken on the application of S6 of the HRA in Scotland demonstrate the lack of explicit compliance within the public sector.  S6 requires the public sector and those delivering services of a public nature to comply with the ECHR.  Both reports can be supplied electronically but in summary:  The 65.5% of those surveyed either did not understand their duties under the Human Rights Act 1998 or could not provide evidence of steps taken to comply with those duties  The 2010 survey for four NGOs Ten out of the 42 public bodies admitted they could not provide explicit steps taken to implement or put into practice compliance with Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 over the last three years4  Even when the public sector has undertaken reports on human rights compliance, there is insufficient evidence that the recommendations have been given effect and about the impact they have made.  For example the 15 recommendations in the (2010).   Also,  we need to learn more about the 5.   There is also a shortage of information about human rights delivery in Scotland compared to elsewhere in the UK.  Permission was not given to extend the inquiries of the GB Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to Scotland in respect of:  The Human Rights Inquiry launched by the EHRC on 6th March 2008, individuals were embedded in service   However the published surveys contained in the report generally do extend to the UK.6  The findings resonate with the experiences of some NGOs in                                             4 Delivering Human  Aid, Amnesty International and Scottish Refugee Council pub Feb 2011, pg 10.  5 http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/NHS-Scotland/MEHRB 6 cutive Summary Report of the Equality and Human Rights   6  Scotland and the recommendations could easily be applied to Scotland e.g. where appropriate, public authorities and voluntary and community sector groups should mainstream human rights into their decision making processes, strategies and business plans, as well as into their relevant policies and   7 The full report will be published in November 2011 but interim findings confirm problems already identified in Scotland including: inadequate time to deliver care which means very brief time allocated to homecare visits  just 15 minutes in a number of cases which does not allow even basic essential tasks to be done properly; lack of control over timing of care visits ailure to deliver adequate homecare.  Proposed Question 1.  Do the SHRC and EHRC agree to work together on such important inquiries so that the benefits of the diligence in the inquiry process and recommendations crafted by the experts are equally enjoyed  across GB?  3. Need for a Human Rights Committee to be established at Scottish Parliament The HRCS believes the establishment of a Human Rights Subject Committee at the Scottish Parliament would lead to better public policy decisions on services and funding for the following reasons   The House of Lords House of Commons Joint Committee on Human Rights has demonstrated the added value of examining all issues through a human rights lens including child poverty and welfare reform as well as traditional issues such as ID cards and policing of peaceful protest. http://www.parliament.uk/jchr  There is little evidence that the current subject committees at the Scottish Parliament explicitly focus on the human rights implications of their work and when Bills are introduced there is only a brief statement about human rights compliance with no detail.   Elected politicians can take the initiative and develop considered and clear policy positions on a range of issues e.g. the current UK inquiry into a Bill of Rights has significant devolution implications.  The Joint Committee on Human Rights has already stated: whether it should include social and economic rights. We believe that there is strong public support for including rights to health, housing and education.8   Review Compliance with Existing Human Rights Law. Make public policy decisions on the design and delivery of services in compliance with existing duties to promote and protect human rights.                                                7Inquiry reveals failure to protect the rights of older people receiving care at home  News Release 20th June 2011  8 A Bill of Rights for the UK? House of Commons House of Lords Joint Committee on Human Rights, Twentyninth Report of Session 200708, printed 21 July 2008 Page 5   7    Save Money Minimise Risk to the public pound by preventing problems arising.  Historically Scotland has paid out huge sums of money where human rights abuses have been proven: as at 16th May 2008 the Scottish Prison Service had settled 1,093 court cases and 1,325 compensation claims submitted under the administrative scheme set up to consider slopping out claims without the need to go to court. SPS has paid out £5.1m in compensation and £2.6m in associated legal fees. A further 600 cases are under offer and another 740 have yet to be considered.9     Ensure Equal Enjoyment of and Respect for Human Rights in Scotland.  MORI Scotland was commissioned by the Justice 1 Committee of the Scottish  o 29% said the term human rights in Scotland meant nothing to them, or formed no associations with the term - most common in working class respondents  o 23% feel that there is inadequate protection of human rights in Scotland, twice those that feel there is excessive protection (11%).  o Women and working class people more likely to feel protection is inadequate10   Treaties Scotland has a duty to ensure all our laws and policies comply with seven UN Treaties as well as Council of Europe Treaties such as the Framework Convention of the Protection of National Minorities.   Improve Accountability of Current Commissions and Commissioners Hear evidence annually about the performance of all relevant Commissioners, using a human rights lens including:  o CCYP)  duties revolve around delivery of UNCRC in Scotland. o Scottish Human Rights Commission (SHRC)  wide range of responsibilities on ECHR, ratified international treaties and duty to encourage best practice.  o Office of Scottish Information Commissioner (OSIC)  accessing information is now regarded as a human right e.g. case law on the ECHR  (2009) ruled social watchdogs can access government information. o GB Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)  examine budget invested in human rights in Scotland on reserved issues and relevant work e.g. current inquiry into human rights and homecare and support of older people in England.  Conclusion                                             9 Justice Secretary, June 08 Scottish Government News Release   10 ustice 1 Committee Scottish Parliament Volume 2 Annex D  8  Previous Committees at the Scottish Parliament have matched Scottish Government Ministerial briefs but now is a good time to add another and establish a human rights subject committee.  The HRCS believes that there has been an insufficient focus on human rights in the last 12 years of the Parliament.  We believe this is an investment in the future and will lead to better, more responsive and efficient public services.  We also believe that human rights are vulnerable in a period of economic downturn, particularly the right to dignity, and the people who most need human rights protection will suffer unless there is targeted, systematic scrutiny of laws, services and policy on preventing abuse, promoting rights and accessing effective remedies.  Proposed Questions 1. Why has the Scottish Parliament failed to set up a Human Rights subject committee? 2. Apart from the standard phra with human rights and ECHR obligations, what evidence is there that human rights are consistently debated, understood and reviewed by existing subject committees?  4.  Demonisation of human rights The perceived imbalance in the enjoyment of human rights is a real problem requiring practical and urgent solutions.  The Government has a duty to address misinformation and stop blaming human rights for unpopular decisions.  The UN has repeatedly raised the issue of press and media coverage.  Recent examples demonstrate the role and influence of the press and media:  UN Committee on Elimination of Racial Discrimination 2003 ""The Committee is concerned about the increasing racial prejudice against ethnic minorities, asylum-seekers and immigrants reflected in the media and the reported lack of effectiveness of the Press Complaints Commission in dealing with this issue. The Committee recommends that the State party consider further how the Press Complaints Commission can be made more effective and can be further empowered to consider complaints received from the Commission for Racial Equality as well as other groups or organizations working in the field of race relations. (Para 13)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child 2008 ""The Committee is also concerned at the general climate of intolerance and negative public attitudes towards children, especially adolescents, which appears to exist in the State party, including in the media, and may be often the underlying cause of further infringements of their rights."" (Para 24)  ""The Committee recommends that the State party ensure full protection against discrimination on any grounds, including by: a) taking urgent measures to address the intolerance and inappropriate characterization of children, especially adolescents, within the society, including the media..."" (Para 25)   UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 2008 ""The Committee notes with concern the stereotyped media portrayals of market and in access to decision- 9  choices in their studies and professions. The Committee also notes the lack of positive media portrayals of ethnic and minority women, elderly women and women with disabilities."" (Para 274)   ""The Committee recommends that policies be strengthened and programmes implemented, including awareness-raising and educational campaigns directed at women and men, and specifically at media and advertising agencies, to help ensure the elimination of stereotypes regarding the roles of women and men in society and in the family, in accordance with articles 2 (f) and 5 (a) of the Convention. It also recommends that the media be encouraged to project a positive image of women, including ethnic and minority women, elderly women and women with disabilities, and to promote the value of gender equality for society as a whole. It calls upon the State party to review periodically the measures taken in order to assess their impact, to take appropriate action and to report thereon to the Committee in its next periodic report."" (Para 275)  Proposed Questions 1. What competence has the Scottish Government to address press and media coverage on human rights? 2. Is this a reserved matter? 3. If yes, what steps will the UK Government take to ensure that human rights are protected in a free press and media?  5. Access to Justice The Scottish Parliament declined to follow the submissions from a range of bodies and chose instead to specifically bar the Scottish Human Rights Commission from providing any assistance to anyone considering or taking a human rights case.  Assistance 11   The Faculty of Advocates has commented: cases have involved Article 6 procedural challenges in criminal proceedings. In a small jurisdiction like Scotland the limited throughput of litigation means that developments in the substantive law could be fitful and protracted were they to depend solely on complaints brought by individuals 12  The Equal Opportunities Commission13 group intervention, and indeed no tradition at all of interest groups taking judicial reviews.14   The net effect is that there is no threat of test cases from the SHRC regarding compliance in Scotland with the ECHR.  Although NGOs can bring forward/fund/advise on individual cases too, there is little evidence of this happening                                             11 Scottish Commission for Human Rights Act 2006 Section 6. 12 Executive (2004) para 5.18  13 Abolished when the EHRC was established. 14    10  in Scotland.   There is also a lack of tradition in Scotland about NGOs pursuing test cases.  The combined effect, it is argued, has led to a culture of complacency.    Proposed Questions 1. Will the Scottish Parliament amend the Scottish Commission for Human Rights Act so that the independent NHRI can bring cases, in line with the Paris Principles?   2. backed up by sufficient funds to bring at least 8 cases per year?   However cases would only be pursued if merited rather than as a matter of routine.  6. Business and Human Rights Agenda Despite a global conference being convened at the Scottish Parliament Professor John Ruggie in October 2010, we are still looking for evidence that the agenda is being promoted by the Scottish Government e.g. through its agency Scottish Enterprise in respect of domestic business involving workers in Scotland.  We note that a number of Scottish based companies are already identified as having included a reference to human right in their company policies.  Proposed Questions 1. What explicit steps have been taken by the Scottish Government to include human rights compliance in tender documents when seeking to award contracts to the private and voluntary sector? 2. What explicit steps have been taken by Scottish Enterprise to promote the June 2011, within those companies operating in Scotland and in respect of their domestic operations? 3. What steps have been taken by the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise in respect of businesses located in Scotland but operating globally?  7. Clear role for NHRI Status A Although Scotland benefits from two NHRIs each accorded Status A by the UN, there is an absence of information about what we can expect from each one.  We believe this would increase accountability.  For example is the NHRI supposed to participate in each UN treaty review process?  Proposed Question Will the SHRC and EHRC deliver training to civil society so that we know what to expect from an NHRI Status A body?  8. Need for Education and Training so that pressure for changes comes from grassroots as well as from governors and managers   The HRCS is pleased to note that 600 out of ScotWhen the right to access information was introduced in Scotland (2005), there were TV adverts at prime timesd by the Office of the Scottish Information Commissioner.  However there has been no such major publicity  11  campaign backed up by education materials across all ages and training programmes about how to exercise our human rights in the course of our everyday lives.  The HRCS considers this to be an omission.   For example it would be useful to have a human rights guide written in plain English distributed free to each household in Scotland.      Proposed Question What steps will be taken to circulate information to each household, provide training and promote understanding amongst ordinary people about what human rights are, how you can exercise you rights and the nature of public sector obligations?  9. Monitoring and Accountability Accessing information to enable an informed decision to be made is a human right. Freedom of Information is a crucial tool in ensuring people and organisations can monitor and hold to account the State in respect of human rights.  The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 (FoISA) sets out the current legal framework but we are e right to information should follow the money that pays for public services.     The Scottish Government announced a Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill in 2011 - 2102 which is 15.  We believe that can only be achieved by a series of reforms.  For example replicate progress announced at a UK level. The UK government is proposing to extend the UK FOI Act to other bodies including the Local Government Association, the NHS Confederation, the Law Society and the Bar Council. Their Scottish counterparts should be brought under FoISA, otherwise Scotland risks falling behind the UK  We are also concerned that new restrictions to the legislation may be introduced, such as further charges for information or measures allowing authorities to refuse more requests on cost grounds. When charges were introduced under Irelanlaw a few years ago, there was an immediate 75% fall in the number of requests. Such measures should not be introduced in Scotland.   We also call on the Scottish Government to: o Make private contractors subject to FoISA. Transparency and openness should be part of doing business with the public sector. Trusts and other arms length organisations running public service facilities such as sports, leisure and cultural facilities, buildings, parking, transport, property, IT, finance and other support services, health, and social care should also be covered as should the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland.  o Make all housing associations subject to FoISA so that tenants and the public generally, have the right to access information.  Such a change fits well with individual and community empowerment strategies. Housing associations are                                             15 The consultation on a Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill  was announced in the Programme for Government 2011-2012 http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/programme-for-government/2011-2012/FreedomofInformation   12  already covered by Data Protection and Health and Safety laws - regulatory laws that give individuals enforceable rights.  A further problem with FoISA as it currently operates is that an apparently simple right can be hugely complex to enforce by ordinary people given the language used by public authorities and the range of rules e.g. on a public body seeking clarification which can cause a delay in getting the information within the 20 working day ceiling introduced by FoISA.  The Minister who piloted the Bill through the Scottish Parliament 2001-2002 Lord Jim Wallace has recently commented: gments, I was struck by just how technical and legalistic much of this has become. I suspect it more important to be conscious of engaging the public and not giving the 16     Proposed Questions 1. What will be the impact of the review of FoISA on the equal enjoyment of accessing information in Scotland from the public and private sectors? 2. \what steps can be taken to make FoISA less complex and more accessible?  10. Process of Reviewing Compatibility Scotland needs a transparent framework which enables human rights decisions and recommendations to be properly assessed for relevance and how they may be interpreted in/applied to, Scotland.  The recent case of Advocate, heard at the UK Supreme Court in May 2010, resulted in emergency and controversial legislation at the Scottish Parliament despite there being sufficient time for a more considered and planned response.     The Cadder case was prompted by the ECtHR decision in Salduz v Turkey  - that the right to fair trial is irretrievably prejudiced if no access to lawyer from 1st police interrogation   July 2010, Lord Advocate issued revised intinterview.  Oct 2010, UK Supreme Court issued its decision that it has no real option but .  Decided one aspect of criminal procedure in Scotland is incompatible with ECHR.  Emergency legislation debated at Scottish Parliament the day after, dealt with a number of issues.  However the majority of those member states which prior to Salduz did not afford a right to legal representation at interview (Belgium, France, the Netherlands and requirements.  In Scotland, an individual had to argue the case all the way to the UK Supreme Court to force legal change.                                             16 Inaugural Seminar and Launch of Centre for Freedom of Information, University of Dundee, 29th January, 2009 - Address by Rt.

We would be pleased to welcome any member of the UN to visit Scotland and meet with civil society organisations either as part of this process or as part of a general fact finding mission.  We are happy to work with the public sector, with Government and with the private sector so that Scotland is more clearly able to demonstrate its compliance with human rights across all aspects of the daily lives of ordinary people.

24,HRW - Human Rights Watch," UPR Submission United Kingdom November 2011   Summary UK counterterrorism policy and legislation continues to undermine fundamental human rights.  The UK is failing to meet its obligations to promote and protect womens human rights.   Since the coming into office of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010, several leading ministers, including the Prime Minister have publicly attacked the concept and application of human rights, both in general terms and specifically the UK's own Human Rights Act and the European Court of Human Rights. The Prime Minister said the prospect of complying with a ruling of the European Court on prisoners' voting made him 'physically ill' and blamed widespread riots in August 2011 on the 'misapplication' of human rights. The Home Secretary called publicly for the scrapping of the Human Rights Act.  Counterterrorism legislation and policies The previous UK government accepted the recommendation to continue to review all counter-terrorism legislation and ensure that it complies with the highest human rights standardsmade during the UPR in 2008.The coalition government in power since May 2010 launched a comprehensive review of counterterrorism measures, and some positive steps have been taken. Human Rights Watch remains concerned that key elements of UK counterterrorism law and policy are incompatible with its obligations under international human rights law. The above-mentioned recommendation accepted by the United Kingdom therefore requires further efforts before it can be considered as implemented.  Diplomatic assurances The government signalled its commitment to expand the use of diplomatic assurances as a means of returning terrorism suspects to places where they face the risk of torture and ill-treatment. The government has agreed memorandums of understandingwith Jordan, Libya, Lebanon and Ethiopia to permit the deportation of foreign terrorism suspects based on assurances of humane treatment upon return. It has used informal assurances to remove terrorism suspects to Algeria and Pakistan.   The use of assurances to return suspects at real risk of ill-treatment violates the UK governments obligations under human rights laws. Arrangements for post-return monitoring included in the memorandums fail to provide an added measure of protection, because of the lack of confidentiality and the consequent risk of reprisals inherent in monitoring an isolated detainee.  While UK courts have blocked some returns with assurances, for example to Libya (under the Gadaffi government) and Pakistan, on the grounds they were unreliable, they have upheld deportations to Jordan and Algeria on the basis of similar assurances despite well-founded concerns about torture and other abuse of detainees. In assessing alleged threat to national security and risk on return it has relied on secret evidence not disclosed to the defendants or their lawyers of choice.   Control orders At this writing, the control order regime, introduced by the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, remained in place until the end of 2011. Control orders impose such serious restrictions on an individuals movement, association, and privacy as to make them equivalent to criminal sanctions without trial.  The procedure for imposing control orders, including the use of secret evidence and a low threshold of proof, violates the right to a fair hearing.  The government brought forward draft legislation in May 2011 to modify control orders to impose less severe restrictions for a maximum of two years and require greater evidence, but failed to improve insufficient judicial safeguards or end the use of secret evidence. In September 2011, the government presented a second bill that would allow it to reinstate the most severe restrictionsincluding communication bans, relocation, and curfews at any time of the day up to 16 hoursin exceptional circumstances.   The government seeks to justify the retention of the control order regime on the grounds that while prosecution is the preferred approach there are some terrorism suspects who cannot be prosecuted because the evidence against them is inadmissible in criminal court and who cannot be deported either because they are British nationals or because a risk of ill-treatment upon return to their country of origin.   Yet the UK continues to prohibit all use of intercept (phone tap) evidence in criminal prosecutions. Its unwillingness to relax the ban on the use of such material calls into question its commitment to prosecution.   Pre-charge detention In January 2011, the maximum length of pre-charge detention for terrorism suspects reverted to 14-days, when the government purposefully allowed the 28-day maximum to lapse without seeking parliamentary renewal.  The government tabled draft legislation in February 2011 to permanently limit pre-charge detention to 14-days; at this writing, the legislation had not yet been adopted.  The government is, at the same time, seeking to create an emergency power to extend pre-charge detention back to 28 days in emergency situations.  Over the past decade, pre-charge detention increased from seven days in 2000, to 14 days in 2003, and 28 days in 2006. While a permanent maximum of 14 days is an improvement, it should be noted that the maximum pre-charge detention in other serious crime investigations is 96 hours (four days).  Fourteen days is significantly longer that in comparable legal systems and by far the longest in the European Union.  Human Rights Watch is concerned that a fourteen day limit remains incompatible with the right to liberty and personal security guaranteed in international human rights law. Moreover, the attempt by the government to retain the option of an emergency 28-day power creates a further risk of abuse.   Access to a lawyer The UK accepted a recommendation during the previous UPR in 2008 that it ensure by law the right of access of detainees to a lawyer immediately after detention, and not after 48 hours. In its mid-term report, the UK government asserted that this right is already enshrined in UK legislation, while noting that the Terrorism Act 2000 allows a senior police officer to delay access to a lawyer for up to 48 hours in terrorism-related investigations. The recommendation in question can therefore not be considered as implemented.    The right of all persons accused of a crime to the assistance of a lawyer is a fundamental procedural guarantee, enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Authoritative interpretations and European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence emphasize that this right must be exercised promptly, both to ensure the right to an effective defense, and as a safeguard against ill-treatment in custody. The UN Human Rights Committee urged the UK in 2008 to ensure that anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge, including persons suspected of terrorism, has immediate access to a lawyer.  Stop and search Police retain counterterrorism powers to stop and search without suspicion in designated areas despite concerns about abuse and discriminatory targeting of minorities. The government introduced temporary powers in March 2011 in response to a January 2010 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that found that existing powers under section 44 of the Terrorism Act violated privacy rights, and were neither sufficiently circumscribed nor subject to adequate legal safeguards against abuse.  While the new powers introduced greater safeguards with respect to authorizations for counterterrorism stop and search areas, and the numbers of stops has fallen significantly, they still allow police officers to stop people without individualized suspicion. At this writing, Parliament had not concluded its examination of an omnibus bill that would permanently legislate identical police powers to conduct counterterrorism stop and search operations. Similar stops at ports and airports under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, continue, despite concerns about ethnic profiling of Black and South Asian people.   Accountability for Overseas Abuse Credible allegations of serious abuse, including torture and deaths in custody, and complicity in renditions and torture, have emerged over the last few years.   Documents discovered by Human Rights Watch in Tripoli in September 2011 show that the UK was directly involved in the rendition of a terrorism suspect and his family to Libya.  Human Rights Watch research has also established at least 5 cases where the UK security services were complicit in torture in Pakistan.   A judge-led inquiry into allegations of UK complicity in renditions and torture of terrorism suspects had also not yet begun at this writing.  In August 2011, NGOs and victimslawyers withdrew their cooperation with the government-established inquiry on the grounds that government-imposed conditions announced in July, including limits on questioning witnesses who had given evidence in secret and government control over disclosure, made an effective process impossible.   The UK rejected the 2008 UPR recommendation to consider that any person detained by its armed forces is under its jurisdiction and respect its obligations concerning the human rights of such individuals. The UK should reconsider the rejection of this recommendation, in line with its international human rights obligations. The UN Human Rights Committee urged the UK in 2008 to state clearly that the ICCPR applies to all individuals subject to its jurisdiction or control, and to ensure prompt and independent investigations into all allegations of suspicious deaths, torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in UK-run facilities. The European Court of Human Rights affirmed in July 2011, in two separate cases, the extra-territorial application of the European Convention on Human Rights. In the case of Al-Jedda v. the UK, the Court applied the Convention to rule that the UK had arbitrarily detained an Iraqi civilian for over three years in a British-run detention center in Iraq.  In the case of Al-Skeini and Others v. the UK, the Court also found that the UK had failed to conduct  independent and effective investigations into the deaths of five Iraqis apparently killed by British soldiers in Iraq.  In September 2011, a three-year public inquiry found a British military regiment responsible for the 2003 death in custody of Iraqi civilian, Baha Mousa, after being subject to inhuman and degrading treatment and sustaining multiple injuries. The inquiry recommended comprehensive steps against hooding and stress techniques in detention, as well as independent inspection of battlefield detention centers. Another inquiry into allegations that up to 20 men were tortured and murdered in British custody in southern Iraq in 2004 had yet to begin at this writing. At this writing the UK government had not produced any comprehensive response to the European Court of Human Rights rulings, and the Baha Mousa Inquiry, in terms of ensuring the application of human rights to the conducts of its armed forces everywhere in the world, especially on detention issues.  Womens Human Rights The UK accepted a recommendation in its last UPR to set up a strategic oversight body, such as a commission on violence against women, to ensure greater coherence and more effective protection for women.  The governments actions over the past few years have contradicted this pledge.  Domestic violence The UK played a negative role in the lead-up to the historic adoption, in May 2011, of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.  The UK made proposals that would have weakened the core of the convention, pushing for limitations on protections for women immigrants and asylum seekers.   The convention is the first legally binding instrument in the region that creates a comprehensive legal framework to combat violence against women through prevention, protection, prosecution, and victim support. It defines and criminalizes multiple forms of violence against women: physical, sexual and psychological violence, as well as forced marriage and female genital mutilation. The treaty also establishes an international group of independent experts to monitor its implementation at the national level.  Sixteen countries have signed the convention; the UK has thus far refused to sign.  Domestic workers At a time when the international community has come together to endorse rights and protections for domestic workers, the UK is going in the opposite direction.  In June 2011, the government announced its intentions to eliminate the Overseas Domestic Worker visa. This visa guarantees to domestic workers access to labor courts and the right to change employerwidely-recognized safeguards against abuses. Domestic workers worldwide face a range of abuses, including excessive working hours, non-payment of wages, forced confinement, physical and sexual abuse, forced labor, and trafficking.  The same month, the International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted the Convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers, setting standards for millions of domestic workers worldwide.  The UK was one of a handful of states to abstain in the vote for the Convention and has thus far not signed the convention.  Fast-track asylum  The UK accelerated asylum procedure is used inappropriately for complex claims involving sexual violence, trafficking, female genital mutilation and domestic violence.  Women claiming asylum on gender-related grounds may be detained and subject to this accelerated procedure, in which claims are decided in just a few days, impeding their ability to adequately prepare their asylum claim and  seek medical advice.  Rejected asylum seekers under this procedure have only two working days to appeal.  While the Border Agency has guidelines setting out particular considerations around gender-related claims, women with complex and sensitive claims encounter disbelief, a lack of expertise, and a system that makes it nearly impossible for them to present their protection needs.  Some women have had no access to female interpreters, case workers or medical staff.  Recommendations  Regarding counterterrorism legislation and policies, the UK should:  Cease reliance on diplomatic assurances against torture and ill-treatment as a means of removing foreign terrorism suspects at risk of such treatment on return.  Reform criminal law to ensure access to all suspects in police custody at the outset of detention, including terrorism suspects.  Repeal the control order regime.   Further reduce pre-charge detention for terrorism suspects to 7 days. Withdraw draft legislation allowing for the extension of pre-charge detention to 28 days in an emergency.   Demonstrate commitment to prosecution as the preferred approach by relaxing the ban on intercept material as criminal evidence.  Introduce a requirement of reasonable suspicion for all counterterrorism stops, including at ports and airports.  Regarding accountability for overseas abuse, the UK should:  Adopt a clear policy that all human rights treaty obligations are applicable to UK operations and facilities outside the UK.  Amend the rules governing the detainee inquiry to permit detainees and other interested parties effectively to challenge evidence given in secret and ensure that final say on disclosure rests with an independent judge or the inquiry panel rather than the government.   Regarding womens human rights, the UK should:  Sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.  Sign and ratify the ILO Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers.  Retain the Overseas Domestic Workers visa.  Include claims based on gender-related persecution to the list of exceptions to the Detained Fast Track asylum procedure.

25,IHRB - Institute for Human Rights and Business," 1     Submission to the United Nations Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review Session 13: United Kingdom November 2011  As a means of encouraging constructive dialogue on private sector-related issues in the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review process, this submission addresses by or involving business.   This submission by the Institute for Human Rights and Businessi (IHRB) was prepared in consultation with a group of over 20 UK-based stakeholders (including businesses, NGOs, trade unions and others) who provided feedback on an initial draft as well as comments at a workshop held in London on 17 November 2011. IHRB thanks participants for invaluable insights to the issues raised and recommendations made in this submission.  The views expressed here are those of IHRB alone.  The Institute takes full responsibility for all content.   Summary of submission Overall UK policy with respect to business and human rights would benefit from greater clarity, a national strategy on this issue and institutional coordination such as through the creation of a focal point for implementation (Part I).  The current financial crisis has raised significant concerns over UK policy decisions detrimental to human rights protections, such as budget restraints to UK national human rights institutions (NHRIs), changes to export credit funding priorities, the potential closure of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, and cost-cutting disincentives to UK civil litigation for victims of human rights abuses by or involving UK companies abroad (Part II). The UK Government has shown significant leadership on many business and human rights initiatives, one of which, its OECD National Contact Point (NCP), could be further enhanced to investigate human rights abuses and enforce recommendations to companies. Responding to UN treaty body concerns regarding its extraterritorial obligations, and supporting uptake of new proposals for increased transparency of international corporate operations, non-The submission offers recommendations for consideration by the UK Government and UN Human Rights Council (Part IV).  PART I:  CONTEXT   In 2008 the UN Human Rights Council adopted the Protect, Respect and Remedy Framework on business and human rights, consisting of three distinct but complementary pillars: the state duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, including business; the corporate responsibility to respect human rights; and the need for greater access to effective judicial and non-judicial remedies instrument, The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, creating the first authoritative global standard for preventing and addressing risks of negative human rights impacts linked to businesses, and created a new UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights to operationalise these tools. Guiding Principle IA1   2 territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, including business enterprises. This requires taking appropriate steps to prevent, investigate, punish and redress such abuse through effective policies, ii   UK Policy Coherence Over the past six years, the work of the UN Special Representative on business and human rights has dramatically raised the profile of this important policy agenda, including in the United Kingdom.  Various UK Government departments have produced guidance and reports exploring domestic and international business and human rights relationships, such as: the Private Sector Development Strategyiii (DfID); Corporate Responsibility Reportiv (BERR); The Private Sector and Human Rights Projectv (MoJ); Business & Human Rights Toolkitvi for overseas missions (FCO/UKTI/BIS/DfID); and The Engine of Development: The private sector and prosperity for poor peoplevii (DfID).    A 2009 Parliamentary inquiry by the UK Joint Committee on Human Rights undertaken to review the  range of business and human rights relevant contexts identified a strong need for greater policy coherence and integration between UK Government departments, and recommended the creation of a national business and human rights strategy.viii  The Joint Inquiry also requested clarification of the responsibilities of private providers of public services under the Human Rights Act 1998ixxclarification would improve consistency of standards under which businesses in the UK are expected to operate, including with respect to growing reliance on private contracting for public services.  If undertaken as part of an overall approach to developing further engagement with UK businesses on human rights generally and their efforts to demonstrate and express, often for the first time, steps taken to ensure respect for human rights, a substantial contribution would be made to demystifying human rights language and impacts throughout the UK as a whole.    xi to the 2009 Inquiry pointed out, the greatest need in the UK is for a more strategic approach to business and human rights.  This involves increased focus and clarity within the UK and in terms of overseas policy (regarding development, trade, investment and diplomatic missions), encompassing a smart mix of incentives, human rights education, guidance and support for UK business domestically, capacity support for host countries and UK businesses abroad, and where needed, better regulation to safeguard human rights and the longer-term interests of UK business.  Greater leadership in this area by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) internationally and as up is a welcome development. The UK Government has looked to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to develop its strategy on the private sector and human rights, taking forward recent work from the Ministry of Justice, the 2009 Inquiry and the work of the UN Special Representative.xii An EHRC business and human rights working group has been created, but its ability to prioritize this stream of work while facing staff and budget reductions is uncertain.   PART II: HUMAN RIGHTS IN TIMES OF FINANCIAL CRISIS  UK export credit funding principles The recent Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD) name change to UK Export Finance (UKEF) recovery.  The information and communications technology (ICT) industry has been further identified as an important growth engine, particularly for SMEs.  Encouragement by the Government for businesses to defend freedom of expression and the right to privacy on the Internet and via mobile phones, such as that currently being demonstrated by Sweden and the Netherlands, will be vital in securing robust human rights protections as well as progressive business opportunities worldwide.     3 The current international economic environment has only strengthened the need for adherence to a common framework of universal social values, good governance and accountability in relation to business activity.  However, on the basis of levelling the playing field with other OECD countries, the UK Government in 2010 eliminated requirements for environmental and social impact assessments on projects with less than 2 year repayment periods or involving less than a roughly £10million UK exporter stake prior to approval of ECGD/UKEF project funding.xiii  As a result, applicants falling under this threshold are no longer informed as a matter of course of the nominal ban on funding of projects The new policy has been a matter of particular concern to many organizations working to promote respect for human rights, particularly because ECGD/UKEF has stated it has no human rights (or other obligations) to anyone outside of the UK.xiv Concern has also been expressed transparency, among several other Export Credit Agencies (ECAs), regarding project screening.  Protecting UK and migrant workers  Another UK Government austerity decision could gravely impact the rights of many UK workers and the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA) has been a highly effective enforcement body of the rights of vulnerable workers within its five industry sectors since 2005.  There are reports that the GLA faces one of two futures, either severe funding cuts or its closure altogether.  Either decision would compound the already missed opportunity by the Government in failing to include the construction sector within its responsible procurement guidelines for London 2012 Olympics labour brokers, and remit should be enhanced, not reduced or diluted through, for example, removal of investigative -led and risk-based presence of some of the most vulnerable within the UK workforce.    Access to justice in the UK effective remedies for human rights claims against UK companies when no such option is available in host countries.  The UK does not provide legal assistance for such cases, and proposed reforms to UK claimants and their legal representatives needed to bring cases against major companies.  The UN Special Representative number of UK legal firms currently taking these cases.xv  The proposals are also a major point of concern for the UN Committee monitoring state compliance with the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) in its recent Concluding Observations on the UK.xvi  PART III: THE INTERNATIONAL IMPACTS OF UK BASED BUSINESSES  The UK OECD National Contact Point  The UK has a strong history of international leadership and support for business and human rights initiatives, such as around the recent development of an International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers.xvii  The UK also strongly supported the recent update of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the inclusion of a new human rights chapter aligned with the UN Guiding Principles.  Though the cross-departmental approach of the UK National Contact Point as a non-judicial mechanism for responding to individual complaints of breaches of the Guidelines by UK companies has been significantly enhanced in recent years, IHRB would welcome further improvements.  Namely, empowering the NCP fully to investigate reported breaches and establishing a formal Government response to negative NCP findings, including relevant departmental responses, such as conditional provision of future ECGD support upon satisfaction of all NCP recommendations.    4  Extraterritorial impacts of UK companies During the term of the UN Special Representative, the UK Government refuted any general international state obligation to protect against extraterritorial human rights abuses by non-state actors.xviii  The UN Special Representative reaty-by-treaty view and the often express or implied duty within many international human rights treatiesxixposition further scrutinised in the 2009 Joint Inquiry report.xx  The international community expects countries like the UK to show leadership in this regard, as seen in the recent encouragement from the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights .xxi More recently, the above-mentioned Concluding Observation from CERD expressed concern at reports of UK registered companies adversely affecting the rights of indigenous peoples to land, health, environment and an adequate standard of living, as well as the prospective introduction of legislative obstacles to UK judicial redress for victims of human rights abuses.  It should be noted that the UK Government has introduced welcome stringent legal liabilities for UK businesses operating internationally with regard to corruption in its Bribery Act 2010xxii, showcasing what is possible regarding appropriate legislative and administrative measures to ensure companies operating internationally are not permitted to act without due regard for their social, cultural and environmental impacts, adequate community consultation, and their responsibilities to respect human rights.  Strengthening UK corporate financial and non-financial reporting and governance The extractive, forestry and hydroelectric sectors have recently been analysed by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, who noted the need for tangible benefits to host communities.xxiii  The European Commission recently introduced welcome reforms of its Transparency and Accounting Directivesxxiv as part of its renewed strategy on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 2011-2014xxv, requiring country-by-extractive and logging operations, which will outline the exact tangible benefit received by host countries. The UK has strongly supported similar plans within the OECD.    IHRB agrees with the UN  suggestionxxvi that reforms of the Companies Act 2006xxviiallowing unrestricted purpose for UK companies could therefore include social and environmental purposes and human rights commitments within UK company constitutive documents, xxviii). Companies Act include accounting for community and environmental impacts as factors relevant to discharging this UN Guiding Principles and closely aligned human rights chapter of the OECD Guidelines, Director duties within the UK could be further strengthened by including express reference to human rights impacts and the need for directors to oversee human rights due diligence as part of discharging their duties.   PART IV:  RECOMMENDATIONS  The following recommendations are made to the UK Government in relation to the above concerns:    Report on progress in implementing the 2009 Joint Inquiry recommendations since the  a national strategy on business and human rights.  In line with recommendations by the UN Special Representative and the European CSR strategy 2011-2014, any national strategy on business and human rights should: o  o responsibilities domestically, hold a high level stakeholder summit on UK implementation of   5 the UN Guiding Principles, and augment diplomatic capacity to integrate business issues in bilateral human rights dialogues with foreign governments, offering technical human rights support to UK companies investing in the country and monitoring for issues of concern. o  to prioritize business and human rights in its work streams, learn from best practice of National Human Rights Institutions globally, and support coordination effectiveness and coherence of their business and human rights engagement strategies across the UK; if the extra-territorial accountability of UK business to all internationally-recognised human rights  not just those under the European Convention  is deemed to fall outside the UK businesses abroad operate consistent with international standards.  Reinstate environmental and social impact assessments for all ECGD/UKEF applications regardless child labour is ineffective; lobby for greater transparency globally in the area of environmental, social and human rights impact assessments for ECA supported projects; and encourage business, especially SMEs, to defend freedom of expression and the right to privacy.  Ensure the Gangmasters Licensing Authority is maintained at current levels and give serious consideration to extending its effective methods of targeted enforcement of employment and other rights into additional industry sectors such as construction, hospitality and social care.xxix  Report on any change to UK Government plans and policy regarding its extraterritorial obligations,   Empower the UK NCP fully to investigate reported breaches of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and establish a Governmental response to negative findings, including appropriate departmental responses.  Support the successful passage and risk-assessed implemecountry-by-country reporting initiative through the Council of Ministers and within the European Parliament.    Encourage incorporation of social purposes and commitments within UK company constitutive documents, and consider including express reference to human rights impact and human rights due diligence as part of discharging director duties under s. 172 of the Companies Act 2006.  rties faced and measures taken.    Increase business and human rights expertise in key Government policymaking processes, for example by engaging and including relevant experts in the human rights advisory group of the UK Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.   Support the operationalisation of the UN Framework and Guiding Principles on business and human rights regarding the rights of indigenous peoples in the context of extractive operations affecting indigenous territories.   6                                                    i IHRB (www.ihrb.org) was established in 2009 to provide a trusted, impartial space for dialogue and independent analysis to deepen understanding of human rights challenges and the appropriate roles and responsibilities of business.   ii Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the UN Doc.

26,IHRC - Islamic Human Rights Commmision,"21st November 2011                               --------------------------------------------------                                       Islamic Human Rights Commission                 -------------------------------------------------- United Kingdom: Submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review  Thirteenth Session of the UPR Working Group of the  Human Rights Council  21st May - 1st June 2012     The Islamic Human Rights Commission is an NGO in special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and social Council. Islamic Human Rights Commission PO Box 598, Wembley, HA9 7XH. United Kingdom Telephone (+44) 20 8904 4222 Fax (+44) 20 8904 5183 Email:info@ihrc.org Web: www.ihrc.org   Executive Summary In this submission, the Islamic Human Rights Commission provides information under sections B, C and D as stipulated in the General Guidelines for the Preparation of Information under the Universal Periodic Review. Under section B, the Islamic Human rights Commission gives background information about the human rights abuses of the Muslim minority living in the UK. Under section C Islamic Human Rights Commission raises concern in relation to Right to equality of law and Right to the presumption of innocence till proven guilty of the Muslim minority in the UK. In section D, Islamic Human Rights Commission makes a number of recommendations for the government to address. B. Background The United Kingdom has a culturally diverse population. Although racism has been common throughout history, Anti-Islam behaviour is on the increase specifically through government apparatus. The criminal justice system in the UK has for centuries been universally regarded as one of the fairest and transparent systems of justice in the world. Mechanisms to extradite those accused of committing crimes in the UK serve to undermine that noble reputation by suggesting the UK criminal justice system is not competent to bring criminals to justice. Actions by the government such as Police raids and citizens being detained without trial have become a norm. The UK introduced extremely controversial anti terrorism legislation in 2000. The Terrorism Act 2000 was widely criticised by human rights organisations with a particular emphasis on Section 44 of the Act and Schedule 7 of the act. Section 44 powers allowed police officers to stop people on the streets without requiring any suspicion. Schedule 7 powers allow police officers to stop people at airports without requiring any suspicion.  Home office figures for security stops under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, released for the first time in 2010, show that the UK has been abusing its stop and search powers at ports. The figures confirmed what human rights groups had been complaining about since the introduction of Schedule 7; the disproportionate targeting of Asian and black communities for security stops.  Figures for 2009-2010 showed a disproportionate targeting of people from Asian and black communities. This trend continued unabated, as indicated by the 2010-2011 figures. We expect the 2011-2012 to show the continued rise of targeting people of Asian and black communities at ports for security checks. In January 2010 the UK government ordered the use of full body scanners as part of new measures to tighten security at airports. The body scanners have been introduced in two major international airports in the UK on a trial basis. The scanners take nude images of passengers to determine whether they have explosives on them. Those chosen to go through the scanners cannot refuse or ask for alternative forms of searches and not be allowed to board their plane if they refuse. The   Additionally, the UK security services have demonstrated discriminatory practices in policing, particularly through the profiling of Muslims. An example of this can be found in the policing of the London Gaza demonstrations of 2008-2009, during which the police demonstrated disproportionate handling of pro-Palestine protestors and pro-Israel counter-protestors. More details of this can be found on the full report published by IHRC on the following link (PDF): (http://ihrc.org.uk/attachments/9213_Gaza%20Demo-FV-LR-v2.pdf) Among key highlighted concerns were: the role and function of Forward Intelligence Teams (FITs), the harassment of press and freelance photographers and the arbitrary handling of laws. More concerns can be found in the above report. C. Promotion and protection of human rights on the ground The Right to Equality before the law The introduction of the Terrorism Act 2000 saw with it the application of Section 44 stop and search powers. The powers allowed police officers to stop and search individuals without needing to suspect the individual of any crime. The powers were broad and used with a particular enthusiasm by the UK authorities leading to a widespread call for the powers to be curbed. The stop and search powers were not only broad but applied in a highly discriminatory way. Figures for stop and searches under Section 44 showed that people of black and Asian backgrounds were enthusiasm for the powers had little to show; the use of these powers had increased from 33,177 in 2004, to 117,200 in 2008, without it resulting in the apprehension or conviction of a single terrorist. In early 2010 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that section 44 was unlawful stating that section 44 violates the right to respect for private life because the power is so broad it fails to provide safeguards against abuse. The government has suspended the use of the powers though the section 44 remains in the statutes at the time of writing. The IHRC has been at the forefront of campaigning against section 44. Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act on the other hand remains in force and continues to be applied with a vigour that is alarming. The Home office figures show discrimination in the application of Schedule 7 against ethnic minority groups1. Figures for 2009-2010 showed that where people were stopped and held for under an hour, the ethnic breakdown was: white people, 45% of stops; Asian people, 25%; black people, 8%; other ethnicities, 22%. The discrimination against ethnic minorities became glaringly obvious when you look for people who were stopped and questioned for over an hour. White people made up 19%, Asian people 41%, black people 10% and others                                                            1 http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/counter-terrorism-statistics/hosb1511/hosb1511?view=Binary   (including Middle Eastern and Chinese) 30%. Even though Asians make up 5% of the UK population, black people 3% and others 1% and White people make up 91% of the population. The figures for 2010/11 are no less depressing and show that the targeting of Asian and black communities under Schedule 7 has in fact increased. The new figures for 2010-2011, released on 13 October 2011, show a 23% fall in the overall number of people stopped under Schedule 7. But when the figures are broken down you see that the trend of targeting Asian/ black communities continues unabated, and has in fact seen a small increase. Of those stopped for under an hour 29% were Asian, 9% black, while white people made up 41%. For those detained for more than 1 hour the figures are white people 14%, Asian people 45% and black people 14%. For detention: white people 8%, Asian people 44% and black people 21%. The discrimination is also present in the collection of DNA material where the figures are white people 7%, Asian people 46% and black people 21%. The figures for 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 do not show the whole picture. They mask the numbers of Muslims being stopped under Schedule 7 and flights from specific countries being  extremely misleading. This heading can cover Muslims who are not categorised as Asian or black e.g. Arabs, Indonesians, Iranians, Kurds etc. This category makes up for 17% of all those stopped. Yet by combining multiple national and ethnic groups under one heading, we are unable to determine the ethnic/national origins of the people under this heading and make clearer assessments regarding racial as well as religious profiling. The figures indicate that the police are targeting people who are perceived to be Muslim. This is despite a recent Europol report stating that the vast majority of terrorist acts in Europe are perpetrated by people of European ethnicity, promoting various secular causes.  The issue of disproportionate targeting of ethnic groups is made worse when you consider the . Officers routinely refuse to identify themselves or the fact that it is a Schedule 7 stop, being aggressive and rude and on occasions where their behaviour amounts to harassment. They ask deeply personal and irrelevant questions to what are their views on arranged marriages to who did they vote for and what are their views about democracy.  The Right to presumption of innocence till proven guilty The actual reality of extradition cases involving detention without trial within the UK is alarming.  Article 7(1) of the 1957 Convention on Extradition provides that an extradition requesn Arrest Warrant and many other extradition treaties, were not incorporated into the Extradition Act 2003. As a result,  many cases are now before the courts whereby individuals are being extradited to the US whereby the bulk of the alleged offence was committed in the UK and is triable in the UK. What is more worrying is that in most of these cases where British Citizens are accused of committing crimes in the UK, government prosecutors have found no evidence to charge them in this country for the alleged crimes and yet these individuals await extradition to the US; this completely undermines the UK criminal justice system. Such individuals should be tried in the UK and not extradited to foreign jurisdictions to face justice. The Right to Privacy and Dignity  body scanners The British Government introduced body scanners in Heathrow and Manchester airports on 1st of February 2010. The scanners, which see through clothes to produce an image of the body, violate Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights -the right to privacy. They are unethical and immoral as they show a persons private parts and the outline of the whole body and violate the civil rights of individuals. The IHRC believes that the introduction of body scanners will lead to discrimination against members of the Muslim Community as their religious beliefs forbid them from going through the body scanners and exposing themselves through this electronic equipment. In our research we have noticed that an overwhelming majority of Muslim scholars consider this practice Islamically unlawful and since the government is refusing to consider alternatives to this procedure, this will have a tremendous impact on Muslims, not only by restricting them from taking part in daily activities, such as work that includes travelling but also restricts them in practicing their religion and is therefore discriminatory. Conservative MP, Ben Wallace, who used to work for QinetiQ, a scanning technology firm, warned that full-body scanners can be unreliable in detecting ""low-density"" materials like plastics, chemicals, and liquids, which are the reason the government, introduced them. The IHRC believes that people have the right to decide who views their bodies whether in person fact that he or she is viewing a near naked image of the passenger. By forcing the passenger to go through the body scanner he is being stripped of his privacy; his right to decide who takes and oss invasion of a persons privacy (particularly for people of various religious backgrounds who believe it is a part of their religious beliefs to not reveal their bodies to others) as they are being forced to reveal their private body parts. The IHRC is concerned by independent reports that the body scanner machines do in fact have the capability to save, store or print images; a potential for further breaches of an individuals privacy. Equally worrying are the cases of abuse reported in the media. For example one headline reads: Heathrow worker 'ogled colleague on scanner' (The Independent). There is a lack of provisions dealing with staff training and supervision so as to stop abuses by those operating body scanner machines. If the objective of the scanners is to ensure that passengers are not concealing explosives or other contraband that would endanger the lives of others, then an  alternative method of screening such as a pat down should be offered as is the case in the US and Canada. It is entirely implausible to believe that airport security officials will subject every passenger to such screening, considering the tremendous cost (around £100,000 for each machine) and time involved. So they must select certain individuals to be put through the body scanners. The IHRC does not believe the government has put in place sufficient safeguards to stop profiling of passengers, particularly Muslim passengers. Scanning is still likely to be conducted on a selective process and which unfortunately, due to the climate of Islamophobia we live in, will mean the profiling of Muslim passengers.  D. Recommendations The Islamic human Rights Commission recommends that the government of the United Kingdom: 1. All stops under Schedule 7 lasting more then half an hour must be recorded. Filming or recording audios of interviews will deter officers from abusing the system and will give confidence to those interviewed their powers there will be proof which they can use to hold officers accountable. Such a procedure will give the process transparency and accountability. 2. Should not extradite any citizen or resident of the UK, to foreign countries to face trial for crimes allegedly committed in UK and which are recognised as crimes under UK law. 3. The government should offer people the right to pat down searches as an alternative to the body scanners as done in the USA and Canada. 4. With regard to tackling profiling and discrimination in policing, some key recommendations include: clarification into the role and function of forward intelligence teams (FITs), placing more importance on pre-demonstration briefings for officers and a call for transparency and accountability in the investigation of incidents of discriminatory policing.

ITMB act as a bridge builder bringing the Traveller communities, service providers and policy makers together, stimulating debate and promoting forward-looking strategies to promote increased race equality, civic engagement, inclusion, service provision and community cohesion. For further information about ITMB visit www.irishtraveller.org.uk   1    Introduction  Gypsies and Travellers have the lowest life expectancy, the poorest educational attainment and the highest infant mortality rate of any group in the UK.1 These facts have been considered by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, who in September 2011noted:  some efforts have been made by the State party to improve the well-being of Gypsies and Traveller communities, the Committee remains concerned that such efforts have not substantially improved their situation. The Committee thus regrets that these communities continue to register poor outcomes in the fields of health, education, housing and employment. 2  The CERD Committee went on to recommend that:  the State party should strengthen its efforts to improve the situation of Gypsies and Travellers. The State party should ensure that concrete measures are taken to improve the livelihoods of these communities by focusing on improving their access to education, health care and services, and employment and providing adequate accommo3  In the Human Rights Councils 2008 UPR report to the UK there was only one e communities.4 Considering Gypsies and Travellers are ethnic minority groups under UK law and experience some of the highest levels of discrimination in the UK, ITMB urge the United Nations to seriously consider their Human Rights in its next UPR report.  This submission proposes three key recommendations for the United Nations to present to the UK. These recommendations are supported by evidence in the following areas and presented in the following order: Eviction of Dale Farm, Planning and Accommodation, Education, Health, Employment and Economic Inclusion, Media and Government statements, Criminal Justice                                                      1 See the Equality and Human Rights Commission 2009, Inequalities experienced by Gypsy and Traveller Communities: A review, particularly pages 5-34  http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/research/12inequalities_experienced_by_gypsy_and_traveller_communities_a_review.pdf  2 See UN CERD, September 2011, Concluding Observations, Seventy Ninth Session, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, page 6, para 27 http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/CERD.C.GBR.CO.18-20.pdf  3 Ibid   4 See UN Human Rights Council Eight Session, 2008, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, page 15, para 15. http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G08/136/44/PDF/G0813644.pdf?OpenElement   2   Methodology   The ITMB policy team work at a national policy level and are guided by the community through the ITMB Irish Traveller Advisory Group. Whilst our primary focus is Irish Travellers we include English Romany Gypsies in our policy work as the two groups share similar issues and the limited government data available generally categorises Gypsies and Traveller as one group.                                                3  Proposed Recommendations  Forced Evictions  Following the forced eviction of Irish Travellers at Dale Farm, we urge the State party to reconsider the future use of force to resolve such issues and ensure Gypsies and Travellers Human Rights are fully respected. The State party should support and promote negotiated, peaceful and long-term solutions to Gypsy and Traveller unauthorised sites. In doing so it should acknowledge that such sites are in many cases the result of a national shortage of sites due to the discrimination Gypsies and Travellers face in the planning process at the local level. (see sections 1 and 2 below)  Planning and Accommodation   We urge the State party to introduce a national or regional strategy to effectively address the severe nationwide shortage of Traveller sites and ensure Gypsies and Travellers rights under article 17 of UDHR, article 11 (1) of ICESCR and article 8 of European Convention on Human Rights are respected. The State party should also take into consideration the concerns raised by the Parliamentary Select Committee for Communities and Local Government over the impact of the Localism Act and new planning guidance for Traveller site on future provision of Gypsy and Traveller sites. (see section 2)   Ethnic Monitoring  We recommend the State party ensure that Gypsies and Travellers are officially categorised and monitored as an ethnic minority groups across all government departments. The Department of Health, Justice and Works and Pensions presently being categorised such under UK law. (see sections 4,5 and 7)  National Strategy  We encourage the State party to develop comprehensive national strategies in line with the EU Framework for National Strategies for Roma Integration (which include UK Gypsies and Travellers) which national 5 The government has stated it will develop sets of policy measures....as an alternative to producing national Roma 6 We would urge the State party to develop national Roma inclusion strategies as well as introducing sets of policy measures to ensure the broad socio-economic inequalities which Gypsies, Travellers and Roma suffer are effectively tackled.                                                     5 To ensure that effective policies are in place in the Member States, the Commission proposes that national Roma integration strategies are designed or, where they already exist, are adapted to meet EU Roma integration goals, with targeted actions and sufficient funding (national, EU and other) to deliver them. It proposes solutions to address the current barriers to a more effective use of EU funds and lays the foundations of a robust monitoring mechanism to ensure concrete results for Roma.

Dale Farm Eviction  1.1  In October 2011 the Coalition Government politically and financially supported Basildon District Council to forcefully evict approximately 400 Irish Travellers from Dale Farm Travellers site in Essex. Despite the UN CERD Committee specifically urging the state party to halt the eviction, the government continued its support of the local authority. The CERD Committee highlighted that ure to assist the communities in finding suitable alternative accommodation (article 5 (e) was an underlying reason why the eviction was deemed necessary.    The Committee urges the State party to halt the intended eviction, which will disproportionately affect the lives of families and particularly women and children and create hardship. The Committee strongly recommends that the State party should provide alternative culturally appropriate accommodation to these communities before any evictions are carried out.7  1.2  The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Thomas Hammerberg, also urged the UK to seek a negotiated, peaceful and long term solution to the issue.8  ITMB would argue that the eviction was disproportionate and a violation of Dale Farm residents Human Rights under article 17 of UDHR, article 11 (1) of ICESCR and article 8 of European Convention on Human Rights.   2. Planning and Accommodation  2.1  The extreme example of the eviction of Dale Farm reveals the huge challenges Gypsies and Travellers face in securing culturally appropriate accommodation in the UK.  Based on the  latest figures 20% of Gypsies and Travellers living in caravans are officially classified homeless (meaning they have no legal place to park their caravans.)9 The key obstacle preventing appropriate provision of sites is the discrimination Gypsies and Travellers experience on planning issues at the local level. The Equality and Human Rights Commission has evidenced such discrimination citing that:   fundamentally, resistance from the settled population to the idea of new sites for Gypsies and Travellers10                                                  7  See UN CERD, September 2011, Concluding Observations, Seventy Ninth Session, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, page 7, para 28 http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/CERD.C.GBR.CO.18-20.pdf  8 Guardian, 2 September 2011, viction of Dale Farm Traveller camp must be halted says UN  http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/02/dale-farm-travellers-eviction-solution  9 EHRC, 2009, Inequalities experienced by Gypsy and Traveller Communities: A review, pages 5-34 http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/research/12inequalities_experienced_by_gypsy_and_traveller_communities_a_review.pdf    5  2.2  However, the government has insisted on introducing localism legislation and new planning guidance for Gypsy and Traveller sites that will have a detrimental impact on future provision. The Parliamentary Select Committee for the Department for Communities and Local Government and the UN CERD Committee have both expressed concerns about the impacts of the on provision of Gypsy and Traveller sites:   requirement for local authorities to provide sufficient sites, there is great concern that Gypsies and Travellers will not have adequate accommodation and that the new system of planning may discriminate against these 11  2.3  These concerns are supported by the June 2011 ITMB research which found that only 1 out of 100 councils interviewed believe the measures in the Localism Act would make planning for Gypsies and Travellers easier, while 55 Councils thought it would make provision more difficult. ITMB conclude that the go and new planning guidance will make the situation for Gypsies and Travellers even worse in terms of insecurity, homelessness, unauthorised development and evictions whilst at the same time increasing community tensions.12   3. Education   3.1  National data from the Department of Education shows that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils are the lowest achieving groups within schools in the UK and have the highest take up of free school meals; a key indicator of child poverty.13 In its September 2011 concluding observations the UN CERD   elative lack of success in addressing under-achievement in schools, particularly for those groups which have been identified as most affected, notably Gypsy and Traveller children and Afro-Caribbeans (articles 2 and 5(e)(v))14                                                                                                                                                         10 EHRC, 2009, Inequalities experienced by Gypsy and Traveller Communities: A review, page 11 http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/research/12inequalities_experienced_by_gypsy_and_traveller_communities_a_review.pdf  11 Select Committee for DCLG, March 2011, Abolition of Regional Spatial Strategies: a planning vacuum? http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmcomloc/517/51702.htm   12 ITMB, 2011, Planning for Gypsies and Travellers: The Impact of Localism, Executive Summary, p. i http://www.irishtraveller.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ITMB_Planning_for_Gypsies_and_Travellers1.pdf  13 Department for Education (DfE) 2010, Improving the outcomes for Gypsy, Roma and Traveller Pupils: final report  https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/DFE-RR043.pdf    6   The Committee continued to recommend:  the State party adopt an intensified approach towards preventing exclusion of Black pupils and set out in detail its plans for addressing under-achievement for those groups which have been identified as most affected, notably Gypsy and Traveller children and Afro-Caribbeans.15  3.2  However, the measures being introduced by the Coalition government will most likely have a disproportionately negative impact on Gypsy and Traveller pupils. The Home Access scheme (HAS) will no longer be available to support low income or mobile pupils and a large number of Traveller Education Support Services have already been abolished or are being significantly cut despite TESSs being cited as an example of good practice by the European Commission.16   3.3  ITMBs 2010 report Roads to Success: Economic and social inclusion for Gypsies and Traveller found that fifty five per cent of the sample of 95 interviewees experienced bullying and discrimination during their time in education.17 The Roads to Success report also found that racist bullying acts as a barrier to participation in school with parents often removing children from schools when this occurs. Considering the evidence of discrimination and bullying and the unacceptably low outcomes for Gypsy and Traveller pupils it is crucial that specific and focused initiatives such as TESSs and the HAS are supported by government to effectively address under-achievement.    4. Health 4.1  According to a report by Leeds Racial Equality Council, Gypsies and Travellers have the lowest life expectancy of any group in the UK and experience an infant mortality rate which is three times higher than the national average.18 Despite these extremely poor health outcomes, Gypsies and Travellers are currently not monitored by the Department of Health (DoH) even though they are classified as an ethnic minority group under UK law.                                                                                                                                                          14 See UN CERD, September 2011, Concluding Observations, Seventy Ninth Session, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, page 6, para 24 http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/CERD.C.GBR.CO.18-20.pdf   15 Ibid  16 European Commission 2011, EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0173:FIN:EN:PDF   17 ITMB, 2010, Roads to Success: Economic and Social Inclusion for Gypsies and Travellers, Executive Summary, p. v http://www.irishtraveller.org.uk/images/roads_to_success.pdf  18 Leeds Racial Equality Council, 2005, Leeds Baseline Census 2004-2005, Summary and Recommendations (iii) http://www.grtleeds.co.uk/information/census.html   7  4.2  Because Gypsies and Travellers are not being monitored by the DoH there is no NHS statistical data on the communities making it very difficult for health service providers to effectively address such poor health outcomes. This lack of monitoring has a serious impact on Gypsies and Travellers everyday health. For example, research indicates that Gypsies and Travellers are dying 10-12 years younger than the average life expectancy, however the NHS and DoH have no way of assessing whether the life expectancy for Gypsies and Travellers has increased or decreased in 2011. 4.3  A report by the University of Sheffield found Travellers face high levels of depression; poor psychological health is often seen in the context of multiple difficulties, such as discrimination, racism and harassment, as well as frequent evictions and the instability caused by this.19 Poor quality or inappropriate accommodation as a result of forced movement inevitably exacerbates existing health conditions as well as leading to new problems. However, despite greater health need, Gypsies and Travellers use mainstream health services less than other members of the population because of practical difficulties, such as complex procedures for registering and accessing services, discrimination and lack of cultural awareness by health staff.20 Finally, there has been no improvement in the high infant mortality rates and lower life expectancy of Travellers. There is a need for a national strategy and ethnic monitoring to be implemented for Travellers across the health system.    5. Employment and Economic Inclusion  5.1  Gypsies and Travellers are not categorised as an ethnic minority group in the Department for Works and Pensions (DWP) and are presently categorised as -Service Personnel and Ex-Offenders. Not acknowledging Gypsies and Travellers ethnic minority status has resulted in them being excluded from DWP research focused on ethnic minority groups. This has resulted in a severe lack of economic and social targeted support.    5.2  As was highlighted earlier, the pervading racism which cuts across all areas of life for Travellers is also reflected in the area of employment. The 2009 EHRC Inequalities Report found evidence that Gypsies and Travellers who live on a site, or who are known to be members of local Gypsy or Traveller families, often encounter discrimination when applying for paid work.21 Similarly the 2010 report by ITMB on economic inclusion, Roads to Success found that                                                  19 University of Sheffield (Van Cleemput, P. et al.), 2004, The Health Status of Gypsies and Travellers in England.

Media and Government Statements  6.1  The 2008 UPR report to the UK made reference to Gypsies and Travellers communities.22  6.2  Hostile media coverage of Gypsies and Travellers continues to date and is exacerbated by regular negative comments by Government and senior ministers towards these communities.23 This is combined with Gypsies and Travellers being consistently presented in a negative light in the mainstream media, with evidence from the ITMB online media monitor indicating that a majority of media coverage focuses on negative accommodation issues.24  Highly offensive language continues to be used without always being deemed unacceptable by the press, statutory bodies and the wider public. Use of the communities continues in mainstream media.25   7. Criminal Justice  7.1  Gypsies and Travellers are presently not recorded in ethnic monitoring data in the Criminal Justice system. Similar to the other examples in this submission (departments for health, work and pensions), the lack of monitoring of Gypsies and Travellers throughout the Criminal Justice system needs to be urgently addressed to ensure the communities Human Rights are respected. Anecdotal evidence from ITMB and other Traveller organisation has identified a high incidence of race hate crimes against Gypsies and Travellers, a key reason for more detailed monitoring.                                                   22 See UN Human Rights Council Eight Session, 2008, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, page 15, para 15. http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G08/136/44/PDF/G0813644.pdf?OpenElement  23 For example, statement by Secretary of State for DCLG, Eric Pickles, warning to all local councils of Travellers during bank holidays  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8446122/Eric-Pickles-gipsies-could-take-advantage-of-Royal-Wedding-bank-holiday-to-set-up-illegal-camps.html   24 ITMB media monitor, 2011  http://www.irishtraveller.org.uk/media/  25 Daily Mail, February 2011, Craig Revel Horwood forced to apologies on-air after branding travellers  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1359816/Craig-Revel-Horwood-apologises-branding-Big-Fat-Gypsy-Weddings-pikeys.html   9  7.2  Discriminatory treatment by the police in dealing with Travellers is widely acknowledged.26  In a recent research report, John Coxhead, a police officer himself, has discussed the institutional nature of discriminatory attitudes in the police towards Gypsies and Travellers, at management as well as frontline level.  The pervasive and aggressively proactive nature of this prejudice is summed up in the words of one officer in his study: 'prejudice towards Travellers in the 27   7.3  Beyond discrimination by the police, at the trial stages, it is well documented that both Travellers within the (youth) secure estate and (adult) prison system are disproportionately remanded into custody pending trial, less likely to receive bail and more likely to receive custodial sentences.28   Conclusion  In 2004 Trevor Phillips, Chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, stated that Discrimination against Gypsies and Travellers appears to be the last 'respectable' form of racism29 ITMB are sorry to say that since then little has changed and Gypsies and Travellers still experience unacceptably high levels of international Human Rights law is crucial to fulfilling Gypsies and Traveller Human Rights and urge the Human Rights Council to support the realisation their rights.                                                             26 Ministry of Justice, May 2009, Access to Justice: a review of existing evidence of the experiences of minority groups based on ethnicity, identity and sexuality, page 32 http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/access-justice-minority-groups-ii.pdf  27 Coxhead, J.

28,JRF - Joseph Rowntre Foundation,"        Submission for Universal Period Review of the United Kingdom 13th Session, 21 May  4 June 2012.     On Behalf of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation       November 18, 2001       Nancy Kelley Deputy Director of Policy and Research Joseph Rowntree Foundation Caladonia House, 5th Floor 223 Pentonville Road London N1 9NG nancy.kelley@jrf.org.uk   - 2 - 1.  Information on submitting organisation: 1.1  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) is an endowed charity that funds a large, UK-wide research and development programme. We seek to understand the root causes of social problems, to identify ways of overcoming them and to show how social needs can be met in practice. Please see www.jrf.org.uk for more details of the work we carry out.  2.  Executive summary: 2.1  This submission is based on published and upcoming research funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on the subject of forced labour in the UK. Our evidence shows that:  There is clear evidence of forced labour in the UK, concentrated in industries with high numbers of low paid, insecure jobs.  Forced labour is at the extreme of a spectrum of exploitation - a continuum from decent work to forced labour.  Forced labour and labour exploitation exists in the UK despite the existence of a civil and criminal legal framework designed to prevent it.  Migrant workers are particularly vulnerable to labour exploitation and forced abuse.   Much more could be done by the UK government to properly enforce existing laws and regulations on forced labour and extreme exploitation. Please note that some of this submission includes evidence from research which is due to be published in the first half of 2012, however, this can be made available on request to the Foundation.   3.  UNHDR and other relevant instruments 3.1  The prohibition against slavery is enshrined at Article 4 of the Universal No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.  An elaborated version of the Article 4 right is found at Article 4 of the European Convention, incorporated into no one s that . In addition to this, a minority of forced labourers in the UK have been trafficked, in contravention of the Palermo Protocols.    4.  A continuum between decent work and forced labour 4.1  Our research has mainly drawn on the definitions used by International Labour Organization, particularly the six indicators in the list below:    Threats of actual physical or sexual violence.   - 3 -  Restriction of movement of the worker or confinement to a very limited area.  Debt bondage, where the worker works to pay off debt. The employer may provide food and accommodation at such inflated prices that it is extremely difficult for the worker to escape the debt.  Withholding wages or refusing to pay the worker.   Retention of passports and identity documents.  Threat of denunciation to the authorities (ILO, 2005).  4.2  If two or more of these indicators are present then there is a considerable risk that the worker is in forced labour. Our researchers have shown that in some cases we can say that workers clearly fall into the category of forced labour. However, the situation for vulnerable migrant workers is often much more complex, with workers in decent work to forced labour via a sliding scale of increased exploitation. Skrivankova (2010) sets out this useful conceptual framework in detail and shows how it can be used to suggest when civil and criminal remedies can be applied. Kagan et al (2011) uses it to help interpret experiences of forced labour and suggests that there are sets of protective and vulnerability factors which move workers away from or towards forced labour.     5.  Evidence of forced labour in the UK 5.1  Two JRF reports published in 2011 (Kagan et al and Allamby et al) provide new evidence of forced labour in the UK. The fieldwork was mostly carried out during 2010.   5.2  In , Allamby et al explore the extent of forced labour among new migrants to Northern Ireland. They found evidence of severe exploitation (sometimes involving forced labour) among migrants working in fishing, mushroom and catering industries and among Romanian Roma migrants. In the mushroom industry they spoke to Eastern European workers who had been isolated in rural areas; were not paid the minimum wage  due to additional unpaid tasks or in some instances, charged large fees for travel, accommodation or to access jobs. The researchers talked to a group of Roma people who had found it very difficult to access employment in the mainstream labour market. As a consequence, they worked in newspaper selling or car-washing businesses in Belfast where wages were sometimes as low as eighty pence and hour.   Some of the Roma the team talked to had also experienced violence and racial discrimination.  Overall, the research found that workers put up with working in very poor conditions and extreme levels of exploitation because it was better than the options available at home. The researchers found that there were few options available for people who exited highly exploitative employment - some nationalities were reluctant to report their experience to the police (due to negative experiences in their home country), some migrants   - 4 - chose to go home without the money they came while others stayed on and looked for more work  with those with undocumented status particularly vulnerable to further exploitation.   5.3  In  Kagan et al investigate the experiences of forced labour among Chinese migrant workers in the UK. Although the researchers conclude that their interviewees were not in forced labour per se, exploitation was widespread. Many of the workers worked very long hours for pay less than the UK minimum wage with no sick or holiday pay. They formed a cheap, flexible labour force. The evidence showed that debt owed to families  who had paid off the snakehead gangs that facilitated the workers entry to the UK  was a big factor in workers having no choice but to work in these ed between £9,500 to £28,700. Pressure to send money home to provide for their families and irregular status mean this group are vulnerable and have few rights. The focus of the UK authorities is on addressing employment of irregular migrants rather than addressing their working conditions. Irregular status meant that the workers had no means of accessing employment tribunals or being able to report their exploitation for fear of deportation.   5.4  Experiences of forced labour in the documents a wide range of abuse of migrant workers in the UK food industry (including agriculture, food processing and some of the catering sector). Interviews with 60 migrant workers were carried out. The evidence shows a culture of fear amongst interviewees which prevents them complaining; harsh supervisory regimes for workers on production lines; overcharging for poor quality tied housing; deliberate over-recruiting of workers to make profits from fees and accommodation charges; and breaking of employment laws in regard to breaks, maternity leave and pay.   Many of these workers are experiencing conditions which clearly meet the definition of forced labour in UK law.  5.5  In 2012 JRF will be publishing a major report on the  (Scott et al forthcoming). This piece of work includes a legal case review; a review of the data available on forced labour from different agencies and interviews with key stakeholders.    6.  Migrant workers are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and forced labour  6.1  Our research mainly draws on the experiences of migrant workers in the UK labour market. Migrant workers were felt to be particularly vulnerable to exploitation which is why the research has focussed on this group; however, this should not be taken to mean that extremely vulnerable British citizens will be immune to this problem. Indeed, a series of recent police raids (Operation Netwing) have uncovered allegations of forced labour involving the exploitation of homeless UK nationals.      - 5 - 6.2  Our research (Allamby, Kagan, Scott) shows that migrant workers are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse due to a range of factors. These include lack of English language; lack of knowledge of their labour rights; lack of advice; no legitimate access to the labour market due to their status; no or restricted access to welfare support; and factors linked to their recruitment and travel to the UK such as debt and fees to agents. However, the relationship is complex due to the nature of the UK immigration system. In a paper for JRF, Dwyer et al (2011) set out for the first time how immigration status and vulnerability are related. In their paper they consider the situation of migrant workers with different immigration status e.g A8 and A2 accession state nationals; spouses with no recourse to public funds; asylum seekers. In particular, they found that visa regimes linking right to residence to a particular job, leave migrants more vulnerable to exploitation and forced labour.  6.3  The UK Home Office have recently consulted on changing the arrangements for migrant domestic workers entering the UK via an Overseas Domestic Worker Visa. These proposed changes are very concerning as they could lead to making an already vulnerable group more vulnerable to forced labour  via being tied to a particular employer or being trafficked into the UK. It would mean a step backwards for human rights for this group of mainly female domestic workers if the Government were to make these changes to the visa rules.   6.4  Our research shows that some migrant workers from other EU nations are vulnerable -trafficking Strategy relies heavily on border-control/immigration measures as tools for reducing trafficking (including for labour exploitation). However, this means there is little in the strategy to tackle trafficking of EU or UK nationals and this is a major policy gap which the Government needs to address.  7.  Failures of regulation and enforcement  7.1  The UK has a wide range of laws and regulations which should address and prevent forced labour and exploitation occurring in the labour market. However, JRF evidence shows that some workers are still being severely exploited. One of the reasons for this is a failure in the enforcement of existing laws and a failure to regulate workplaces sufficiently. A new paper from Balch (2012, forthcoming), sets out the problems and gaps that exist in enforcement and regulation. He highlights a number of issues:  7.2  Differential enforcement  some areas of the low wage labour market are better regulated than others. These tend to be those where labour providers are involved such as employment agencies and gangmasters. For areas where there is direct employment there is in fact very little inspection or regulation by government. There has been a positive response in our research to the work of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA) in preventing rogue and exploitative gangmasters operating in the sectors it regulates. However, the GLA has limited resources   - 6 - available and covers a relatively narrow range of sectors. There is less thorough regulation of labour providers outside the GLA remit and evidence that gangmasters move sector to avoid inspection by the GLA. The government has so far failed to respond to calls to expand the remit of the GLA or to use the GLA model to better regulate all labour providers and therefore to improve the protection of human rights for the most vulnerable workers.   7.2  The regulatory environment is extremely complex and hard to navigate. A (minimum wage); the Health and Safety Inspectorate; GLA; Employment Agency Standard Inspectorate. There is no overarching labour inspectorate in the UK.   7.3  The UK does not take an overview of forced labour  there is no system for routinely monitoring, recording and reporting on cases. There is a need for independent system of monitoring and for the government to be more accountable.   7.4  There is a lack of knowledge of forced labour among agencies including the police. Greater awareness of the new offence of forced labour and the law of trafficking for labour exploitation is needed by police officers. The role of UK Borders Agency in enforcement shifts the focus on to illegal employment of migrant workers without the right to work rather than addressing the exploitation of the worker.   7.5  The new forced labour offence in Section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act (2009), has been welcomed by many stakeholders as step forward in tackling forced labour as it decouples workplace abuse from trafficking. The police have a clear duty to investigate in this area, but it is up to the government to ensure that the is some priority given to this crime as well as the resources available to run the expensive multi-agency operations that can be required to bring perpetrators to justice. A recent precedent was set by PA v Commissioner of the Police of Metropolis (200(). This was a judicial review case over the failure of the police to investigate and prosecute a trafficker for offences including forced labour. In this case the police accepted they had acted in breach of the investigative duty imposed on them under Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights.     7.6  In addition it is important to recognise that employment law is generally enforceable via the employment tribunal system where responsibility is placed on the individual employee to prove their case against the employer. This makes it extremely difficult (impossible for irregular migrants) for vulnerable migrant workers to be able to access justice and to seek compensation for unpaid wages or other offences under employment law. The UK government have also announced a reduction in legal aid for employment cases and propose changing the rules on unfair dismissal.

29,JS1 - Joint Submission 1,"1      Association of Visitors to Immigration Detainees (AVID) and Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID)  United Kingdom Submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review Second Cycle, 13th Session 2012 Word count:  2815   For further information about this submission please contact:   Ali McGinley  Director, AVID  0044 207 281 0533 Ali.mcginley@aviddetention.org.uk  Dr Adeline Trude Policy and Research Manager, BID 0044 207 650 0728 Biduk.adeline@googlemail.com  About AVID: We are the national network of volunteer visitors to immigration detainees in the UK. Established in 1994, AVID has over 16 years experience in supporting immigration detainees wherever they are held; our 18 member groups visit in immigration removal centres (IRCs), short term holding facilities (STHFs) and prisons. Working with and through our membership, AVID collates evidence of the daily realities of immigration detention and uses this to present a collective voice for change. About BID: BID is a national charity established in 1999 to improve access to bail for all those held under Immigration Act powers.  BID works across all removal centres and prisons to provide immigration detainees with advice, training and representation, helping around 2000 detainees each year. BID also carries out policy, research and litigation work directed towards access to justice for immigration detainees.    2   1. About this submission 1.1 In this submission we wish to highlight that many of practices in relation to the immigration detention of vulnerable asylum seekers and other migrants are at odds with its obligations under the UK Human Rights Act and the European Convention of Human Rigrights contained in the ECHR.  1.2 We draw attention to the immigration detention of vulnerable adults, and in particular to the identification and treatment of detainees with mental health disorders. Many are not receiving humane treatment in line with the UK Border Agency (UKBA) of care towards those deprived of their liberty for administrative purposes. We make particular reference in this regard to the ECHR Articles 2 (the right to life) and 3 (that no one shall be subject to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment).  1.3 Our concerns are based on evidence uncovered during joint research and policy work on mental health in immigration detention since August 2010, complemented by the experience of both organisations in working directly on immigration detention matters on a day to day basis. We also refer to recent UK case law.  2. Context: Immigration Detention in the UK 2.1 The UK has statutory powers of detention in respect of asylum seekers and other migrants and currently detains over 30,000 people each year.  The majority of those detained will have claimed asylum at some point (64% of those held in 20101). The powers to detain are set out in the 1971 Immigration Act. The UK may detain in 11 designated immigration removal centres (IRCs2) and 4 residential short term holding facilities (STHFs3): these places are included in the official Home Office statistics. However, immigration detention may also be in prisons; other short term holding centres at ports, and police stations- these places are not included in the statistics. The number held annually is therefore believed to be much higher than official records show at any one time.  2.2 The UK has derogated from the European Qualifications Directive and as a result there is no upper time limit on the length of detention. The longest period of detention as at 30th September 2010 was just under five years4. Figures show that of all those detained as at 30th June 2011 (2,685), 15% were held for six months or more (407)5.                                                             1 UKBA, Immigration Statistics April  June 2011 available at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/immigration-asylum-research/immigration-tabs-q2-2011v2/detention-q2-11-tabs 2 Brook House, Campsfield, Colnbrook, Dungavel, Dover, Haslar, Harmondsworth, Lindholme, Morton Hall, Tinsley House  3 Larne, Pennine House, Colnbrook and Cedars 4 House of Commons Hansard, 25th January 2011, 36217 accessed at http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110125/text/110125w0001.htm#11012554000019 5 UKBA, Immigration Statistics April  June 2011 available at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/immigration-asylum-research/immigration-tabs-q2-2011v2/detention-q2-11-tabs  3    3. Developments since the preceding review and gaps in the previous report  3.1 It is unfortunate that the immigration detention of adults did not feature in the previous review. With the exception of a commitment made to end the detention of children, there has been no discernible progress in human rights terms since 2008. In some areas the situation has deteriorated. The UK is now detaining many more than it was in 2008; three new facilities opened in 2011 alone6. As of 2010, the UK has detention facility (Harmondsworth IRC).  3.2 The UK is also detaining people for longer periods. This has come under intense criticism from NGOs and statutory monitoring bodies7. The High Court recently found that one detention for 4 years 11 months was unlawful throughout8. In 2009-10 £12 million was paid in compensation and legal costs for unlawful detention cases9. For many detainees, removal from the UK within a reasonable time  the statutory purpose of immigration detention - has ceased at some point to be achievable yet detention continues, at great cost both to the public purse and the mental health of detainees.  3.3 The detention of children also became increasingly controversial during this period. Despite a commitment to end the immigration detention of children (May 2010), the government opened a new family detention facility in 2011. This is described by UKBA as -departure-this is a secure facility where families are held under Immigration Act powers.  It has areas where families and individuals can be held in isolation.  3.4 Some concessions have been made in policy on child detention, and a time limit of one week has been set (yet to be circumscribed in legislation). However, many of the systemic problems, including barriers to accessing to quality legal advice, have not been addressed. A current bill in parliament would effectively make the position of these families even worse by excluding some families from Legal Aid prior to their detention10.   3.5 We are also gravely concerned that the UKBA is separating children from their parents by holding parents in detention. This is without time limit. We have worked with families who have been separated this way for long periods; some children have been placed in statutory care as a result. Such                                                             6 people) 7 See for example: Independent Chief Inspector of UKBA A thematic inspection of how the UKBA manages foreign national prisoners (November 2011), Detention Action Detained Lives (2009) 8 Sino, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] EWHC 2249 (Admin) (25 August 2011) 9 House of Lords Hansard,HL3794 accessed at  http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/101129w0001.htm 10 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill (currently being debated in Parliament)  4  3.6 Recommendation: That the UK should consider its human rights obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and revisit its commitment to end the detention of children. The detention of children should end immediately. Families should never be separated for the purposes of immigration control.  3.7 Another gap in the previous review is the detention of trafficked people. Research by the Poppy Project found that 21% of their trafficked clients had been detained in IRCs or prisons and that despite exhibiting symptoms of post-traumatic-stress-disorder only 15% of these were given medication in detention.11  3.8 Recommendation: The UK Government should take steps to prevent victims of trafficking being held in immigration detention by improving procedures for identification and referral of trafficked persons.    4. Promotion and protection of Human Rights on the Ground Failure to protect the right to life:  Article 2  4.1 Article 2 places an obligation on the state both to refrain from taking life and a positive duty to take appropriate measures to safeguard life. These obligations are particularly relevant for those in state custody for whom the state has a duty of care. There is a higher risk of suicide generally amongst detained populations12groups including  young adults, males, those who have suffered a previous traumatic experience, those with a history of contacting mental health services and those who do not have family or social support13 consists of these high risk groups.  4.2 In the period since the last review, there were five deaths in immigration detention and during removal14.  4.3 There were 183 incidents of self harm that required medical treatment in 2010 in IRCs. In the same period, 15. These figures do not include detainees held in short term holding facilities or prisons. 4.4 HM Chief Inspector of Prisons (HMCIP) found that half of all the IRCs inspected in 2009 were not judged to offer a sufficiently safe environment for detainees16. HMCIP has repeatedly expressed concerns that mental health provision in IRCs is inadequate17.                                                             11 Stephen- London: Poppy Project (2008) 12  (1999)  13 Ibid  14 House of Commons Hansard, 13th September 2011, c 1132W accessed at : http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2011-09-13a.70818.h&s=detention#g70818.r0 15 www.freemovement.org.uk on 16th march 2011  16 HMCIP Annual Report 2008-9 p15  17 See, for example: HMCIP (2010) Report an announced inspection of Brook House IRC (15-19 March 2010) p15, HMIP (2010) Report on an announced full inspection of Harmondsworth IRC (11-15 Jan 2010) p31  5  4.5 Preventive strategies for the reduction of harm to vulnerable detainees in IRCs are not in line with the equivalent standards in the UK Prison Service. For example, first night screening including a detailed assessment of risk of self harm is not carried out in IRCs.   4.6 Operational management of IRCs is contracted out by the UK government to commercial operators and HM Prison Service18. Provision of healthcare is also sub-contracted, resulting conditions in detention reveal uneven provision in terms of mental health support across the standardised allocation of mental health nurses, or other staff trained to support those with mental disorder.    4.7 Recommendation: That the UKBA discharges in full its positive obligations under Article 2 with respect to those detained under Immigration Act powers and for whom it has a duty of care. This should include as a very minimum, the alignment of protection and treatment for mentally disordered and vulnerable detainees with current provision in the prison service.  4.8 Vulnerable adults including people who have survived torture, pregnant women, disabled people, the elderly, those suffering from mental illness or with serious medical conditions are routinely detained. AVID and BID have become increasingly concerned by the number of detainees we see who are suffering from mental disorder. The mechanisms in place to protect these groups have been considerably weakened in recent years. This has compounded an already difficult and potentially damaging situation for the most vulnerable.  4.9 The first mechanism is statutory provision: Rule 35 of the Detention Centre Rules.  This is the mechanism through which concerns about those passed to UKBA to enable release where required19. NGOs including AVID and BID have raised concerns for some time about the efficacy of this process20. In 2009 an audit of the process by UKBA revealed the dysfunction of Rule 35 and its failure to protect the vulnerable: in 91% of the audited cases, detention was maintained21.  4.10 detention of vulnerable groups has been considerably diluted. This policy outlines those groups of pe22.  4.11  was                                                            18 Current private providers are: Serco, Group 4 Securicor (G4S), Mitie PLC, and the GEO Group  19 UK Legislation: Detention Centre Rules (2001) Rule 35.

This effectively alters the previous presumption against the detention of these groups to a new presumption of detention, provided their specific detention. The UKBA has confirmed to NGO stakeholders including both AVID and BID that there is no agreed policy definition or .  4.12 This policy change effectively dilutes the policies to protect vulnerable people from detention, enabling the Secretary of State to detain more broadly, and from a wider range of vulnerable people whose conditions may be injuriously affected by their detention.  4.13 The aforementioned policy on those people deemed unsuitable for detention was amended further with regards to the level of severity of mental illness that would be deemed unsuitable for detention.  Prior to August 2010, the policy stated that detention of  exceptional circums23. This those suffering from serious mental illness which cannot be 24.  This represents a substantive shift in the policy, in that it suggests that those with serious mental illness are now suitable for detention rather than unsuitable. It also suggests that there is a presumption in favour of detention for those whose mental disorder is deemed to be less serious.   4.14 Further, once in detention, the risk of further mental deterioration is well documented25. Many AVID member groups, who visit in every IRC in the UK, have highlighted the negative impact of immigration detention on mental health of those they visit.  4.15 Recommendation: That the UKBA fulfils its positive obligations under Article 2 by ensuring its duty of care is consistently applied throughout its policy guidance. In particular, the UKBA should reverse the policy amendments to the Enforcement Instructions and Guidance (Chapter 55.10 Persons Unsuitable for Detention) to ensure that vulnerable groups included those with mental disorder are not detained.   Violation of Article 3: Prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment 4.16 article 3 of the ECHR in two recent cases26(October 2011).  In these two cases the prolonged immigration detention of people suffering from severe mental disorder was found to amount to inhuman and degrading treatment.  4.17 The case the detention of this man between April and September 2011 was unlawful. In prison and psychiatric hospital prior to detention he had psychotic symptoms and had a history of self harm, and this medical history was known to UKBA prior                                                            23 ibid 24 ibid 25 See, for example: Pourgourides, C.

Medical reports clearly state that immigration detention would lead to a regression in his psychotic state. Whilst in detention he was regularly placed on suicide watch and was assessed by a psychiatrist as being ununtil a second High Court intervention in September 2010. The High Court found that in detaining S, the UKBA had breached both negative and positive obligations under article 3 ECHR, in that the circumstances of his immigration detention amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment, but also that the UKBA had failed to put appropriate measures in place to ensure that he was not subject to this treatment27.  4.18 ry of State had unlawfully detained a man with severe mental illness between June and October 2011. While serving a prison sentence prior to detention, BA was twice admitted to hospital under the Mental Health Act as a result of deterioration in his mental health  he had a history of psychosis and refusing food and fluid. On his discharge from hospital BA was detained in an IRC, despite evidence from his psychiatrist that his mental health would deteriorate in detention. The UKBA continued to detain him despite various medical professionals raising concerns with UKBA about his poor mental health. The IRC healthcare manager noted that BA was unfit for detention and that as a result of his refusal of fluids he was near death. The centre maintained until a High Court order on the 7th October 2011. The High Court found that the circumstances of his detention amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment under Article 3 and described 28  4.19 Recommendation: In light of the recent judgements

30,JS2 - Joint Submission 2," 1 SYMAAG (South Yorkshire Asylum and Migration Action Group) with ASSIST (Asylum Seeker Support Initiative Short Term) and the NRC (Northern Refugee Centre)  Submission to the Universal Periodic Review by the U.N. of the UK 012  Executive Summary This submission argues from experience of working with and alongside asylum seekers in South Yorkshire that the U.K. government is failing to honour the human rights of migrants and asylum seekers. This submission covers the asylum system  forcible returns to unsafe   Sheffield City Council is one of the few local authorities to welcome refugees in recent years from Liberia, Ruanda (Congolese), Burma, Iraq, Ethiopia and Somalia under the UNHCR Gateway scheme. The city was the first City of Sanctuary in the U.K. In the view of our organisations, the UK would better demonstrate the spirit of the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention by expanding its participation in this scheme.   Section One the Issues  The U.K. Asylum Seekers and Migrant Workers  Issue1. Fundamental international asylum rights are breached by the U.K. government because there is no legal way for many if not most refugees fleeing torture and persecution to actually present themselves in the U.K. to claim asylum. Even when they get to the U.K. it is made as difficult as possible for refugees to register a claim with only one centre in Croydon London, many miles away from areas like South Yorkshire in the North of England. This clearly breaches the spirit of article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states that everyone has the right to go to another country and ask for protection if they are being persecuted or are in danger of being persecuted.  This is a question also for the E.U. as a whole where FRONTEX agency  migrant who has been criminally trafficked..  Issue 2. The absolute right in Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human gnored by the UKBA policy of  forced returns of asylum seekers to war zones, and to states where they patently risk torture and / or  inhuman treatment. In South Yorkshire we have experience of such deportations or threatened deportations to Iraq, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, the DRC, Sudan and Zimbabwe.   2  Issue 3 The U.K. is undermining fundamental human legal rights  for those claiming asylum by damaging cuts to legal aid for immigration cases and cuts in funding for advice services for asylum seekers and refugees. The U.K. is currently holding the chair of the Council of Europe and is actively seeking to restrict the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights where the claimed infringement results from statute or a decision of a higher court. A key reason appears to be to prevent   immigration cases from being heard by the European Court of Human Rights   Issue 4 The U.K. still refuses to ratify the ICRMW (International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families).and is one of only a tiny number of states refusing to ratify the 2011 ILO convention on domestic workers. SYMAAG along with other organisations in Sheffield has organised public meetings on these issues.  Issue 5 Child Detention. Despite the U.K. being signatory to the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and  pledges from the current Coalition Government to end child detention in immigration cases the practice continues.  Issue 6 Rights to Family Life and Marriage Regulations and government policies constantly threaten the rights of asylum seekers and refugees to find sanctuary with their families in the U.K. and to marry who they choose.  Issue 7 We in Human Rights declarations describes exactly the treatment of asylum seekers and many migrants by the U.K. government and the United Kingdom Borders Agency through inadequate support and destitution. This has become clear in Sheffield and South Yorkshire over many years and certainly in the last four years since 2008. a) We and other Sheffield asylum rights and welfare organisations (in particular ASSIST) have extensive experience of asylum seekers left destitute, and  homeless. b) Asylum seekers have as a matter of policy been refused access to health care,  c) subject to degrading and inadequate forms of support and payments.  d) Asylum seekers are refused the right to work to support themselves.  In our view the U.K. government is in clear breach of its own Human Rights Act    Section Two: the Evidence base  Issue 1 The problem of no legal route to claim is created by the combination of visa regimes, carrier sanctions and juxtaposed controls. This is compounded by the Crown Prosecution Service and defence lawyers not being well briefed on defences available   3 under the Refugee Convention to those who use false documents. Some wrongful convictions reach the appeal courts, (see e.g. R v M, MV, M and N [2010] EWCA Crim 2400 and R v Jerdi [2011]] EWCA Crim 365) but our organisations meet many others who have not had the legal support or resources to make these challenges. Support organisations for asylum seekers in Sheffield and South Yorkshire have many examples  migrants forced to seek covert entry or to use inaccurate entry documents who have later been recognised as bona fide refugees fleeing torture, violence or inhuman treatment.  Regarding the access point for making a claim, we are seeing people in South Yorkshire who have been dropped off a lorry in the north of England with no English language, no awareness of where they are or what to do, yet they have to travel 200 miles south again to Croydon to claim asylum.   The practice and exclusionary policies of FRONTEX are documented in SUPPORTING DOCUMENT (p.11 ) with extracts from a recent Research Briefing from SYMAAG.  Issue 2  Amongst many recent cases in South Yorkshire which evidence this willingness to forcibly deport asylum seekers to manifest danger and violence (and also evidence a culture of disbelief of asylum seekers in the system) are those of two asylum seekers who are in effect stateless, and we contend should be treated as such, and asylum seekers from the DRC and Zimbabwe.  One a stateless young man of twenty born in Afghanistan who as a child escaped without his family to Iran and eventually to Sheffield where he lived and was educated and made a new life. The UKBA detained him for deportation to Afghanistan where he has no family Campaigners managed to get the courts to intervene and he is back in Sheffield.  The second a stateless disabled  was born in what is now Eritrea. Her whole family was murdered by Ethiopian forces due to their support for a group called the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) in 1988 but she was one of the few in her village who managed to escape. She fled to Sudan and then Saudi Arabia where she worked as a nanny/household helper for a Saudi family. She suffered an accident in 2000, which left her with difficulty walking and meant she could not carry out some tasks. The family she worked for stopped paying her wages, and then some years later (on a trip to the UK) they abandoned her alone in London with no money and no identification. The Home Office is currently planning to deport her to Ethiopia. This is despite the fact that she  has never lived in Ethiopia and has no contacts there, and does not speak the language.  The third a Congolese asylum seeker and political refugee and  a prominent volunteer worker, pastor and organiser in Sheffield over nine years who although found guilty of  The judge not only halted his deportation but on the evidence of the real threat of torture and violence should he be sent to the DRC, gave him the right to remain as a refugee.     4 The fourth a mother and two daughters from Sheffield who were detained for several months in Yarlswood detention centre with a view to deportation to Malawi, because, although Zimbabweans, they had fled sexual violence in Zimbabwe and came to the UK on forged Malawian passports. CDAS and SYMAAG joined with many others in campaigning on their behalf. Following a successful  judicial review of their cases, the Home Office granted them indefinite leave to remain.    Issue 3 Cuts in legal aid threaten human rights to a fair trial  In 2001/2, 458 solicitors held contracts to do legal aid work in immigration and asylum. Following cuts in public funding, by 2009/10 this had reduced to 170 (evidence given by the Law Society to the High Court in R (on the application of Medical Justice) [2010] EWHC 1925 (Admin)). Then in June 2010 cuts in legal aid forced the closure of a major provider of free legal advice and representation to asylum seekers: Refugee and Migrant Justice. In July 2011 cuts in legal aid resulted in the closure of a local office in Sheffield  of the Immigration Advisory Service (the largest U.K. national agency which closed with 200 staff losing their jobs) with many asylum seekers losing legal support and delays in cases. The oldest national agency the Refugee Council faced cuts of 62% in April 2011 from government for its advocacy and asylum seeker and refugee support services. In Sheffield the main refugee agency the Northern Refugee Centre has faced serious cuts in government funding and has severely restricted its advice and advocacy work in the current year (2011) The cumulative effect is that access to justice for asylum seekers is decimated. For impact on U.K. and ECth September 2011)  Issue 4 Migrant workers rights The Coalition government is seeking to remove an essential safegurd for domestic workers coming to the U.K. in the abolition of the special visa for such workers.(See recommendations)  Issue 5 Child Detention The present U.K. government still has a policy of detaining children during forced deportations. A Sheffield family was deported in October 2011 to the Gambia after detention of the children  Due to the persistent refusal of the family to leave the UK, the returns plan proposed that if necessary the family could be split - with the father returning with the children if the mother attempted to disrupt the removal.  A team of arrest trained officers from South Yorkshire LIT (Local Immigration Team) attended the property in Sheffield and the family were removed to Cedars ( a new detention centre) for one night prior to their flight..  On arrival at the airport the following day, the mother had to be removed from the plane before take-off as her behaviour was disruptive and causing distress to the children and other passengers. As agreed by the panel, the children returned to Gambia with their father. Plans were quickly made to remove the mother on the next available flight, to ensure the family were re-united as quickly as possible.(UKBA United Kingdom Borders Agency Part)   5  Issue 6  Rights to family life and marriage   A Zimbabwean husband and wife face deportation from Sheffield  she  Their daughter has only known England as a home and has been educated there and will take important end of school exams and has been encouraged to apply for a bursary to go on to university. The UKBA say immediate removal of the whole family will not threaten the well being of the children. The U.K. government has been repeatedly challenged on its view of Zimbabwe as safe for any returning refugees from discrimination and violence  Issue 7 Inhuman and degrading treatment of asylum seekers   (a) Destitution  The clearest evidence for treatment of failed asylum seekers is in  the work of ASSIST (Asylum Seekers Sheffield Intervention Short Term) which supports asylum seekers who are now destitute in Sheffield. There is also a small ASSIST group in Rotherham. They collaborate with SYMAAG and other local agencies and campaign groups. In 2010/11 nearly 25% of destitute failed asylum seekers clients were from Iran (57 of 219).The other large groups were from Eritrea, (25)Zimbabwe,(21)Iraq (18),Ethiopia (14),Congo Kinshasa (11),Afghanistan (10), and Somalia (10)  war zones or manifestly failed states or oppressive regimes. The ASSIST Helpdesk had 1183 enquiries an average of 25 a week with money (330) housing (312) and food (253) dominant. ASSIST found 41 rooms for 61 people, and with a local church provided a night shelter for up to 18 men and women daily  76 over the year an 82% increase in men and a 45% increase in women from the previous year.

Like most asylum seekers he was not allowed to work legally. In 2010 he had been waiting seven years for a decision on his claim for asylum. Seven years of living on food vouchers. In February 2010, immigration officials came to his house to detain him for working illegally. At his first hearing at Doncaster magistrates court, he explained that by not allowing him to work 'the law makes me a criminal'. On 17 March he appeared at Doncaster crown court for sentencing. The barrister representing him presented a thick file of supporting documents to the judge. This contained his  history of persecution in Iraq; of his political activism there (he is a communist); character references and supporting letters from his many friends and comrades in the UK. The barrister had been briefed well the experience of Iraq and what life is like for asylum seekers who cannot work while they wait years for a decision on their claim. A picture of the persecution experienced started to form: he had had to load the bodies of seventy villagers, killed by poison gas in Sewsenan northern Iraq in 1988; his brother was killed by Saddam Hussain's political police; he was tortured so much that he couldn't recall how some bones were broken; his family were harassed for their political beliefs. The judge started to take notice. He seemed shocked that this man was totally without cash and seemed to appreciate what it must be like to be separated from your friends and family for seven years.The Kurdish man from Iraq stood, proud   7 and dignified, behind a glass screen with an interpreter, as the judge gave his sentence. 'I have never heard such a testimony in my life' he said. 'Given such mitigating circumstances I am not going to send you to jail.' This appearance in court educated his barrister, the judge and everyone else about what life for an asylum seeker can be like in our civilised country. ( adapted from  Stuart Crosthwaite SYMAAG secretary Institute for Race Relations (I R R) News Service April 8th 2010)   Section three: recommendations  (i) The 2008 Universal Periodic Review for the U.K.  On the last occasion when the U.K. was subject to a Universal Periodic Review in 2008.The Working Group recommendations relating to our concerns in the field of asylum rights in 2008 were rejected by the U.K. government  Recommendation 20 Protect the children and families of migrants and refugees and accede to the International Convention on Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their families (ICMRW).Was met by a response from the U.K. government that it the idea  of the ICMRW as the answer.  (General Assembly Human Rights Council Eighth Session 25th August 2008 p.10)  Our experience in South Yorkshire suggests that ratification of the ICMRW and the ILO Convention on Domestic Workers 2011 by the U.K. government should be a necessary part of changes in policy in these fields  Recommendation 24 Withdraw its reservation against the Convention on the Rights of the Child concerning the provision that detained children be separated from adults while in detention as well as the withdrawal of their reservation concerning refugee and asylum seeking children. (General Assembly Human Rights Council Eighth Session 25th August 2008 p.11)  Although  the U.K. government withdrew its reservation to the CRC, there are still concerns about the use of detention even as a last resort for children. The Cedars is presented as not being detention, but it is run by G4S, whose employees were criticised by the Chiedeath of an adult detainee during removal. We are very doubtful that the regime at is run by this security firm. G4S employees are on 24 hour guard, search detainees, and escort them to and from the . Although the Cedars is locked and has a high perimeter fence, it appears from this that it is run internally as  secure establishment. In the 2008 report of the Working Group the UK A/HRC/8/25 para 41,   8 Algeria noted that refused asylum seekers do not always receive support. The ASSIST experience Issue 7 para a above shows that this problem has not been addressed. See also Coping with Destitution: Survival and livelihood strategies of refused asylum seekers living in the UK, (2011) Crawley, Hemmings and Price, Centre for Migration Policy Research, Swansea University and Oxfam.     (ii)  by the U.K. government  SYMAAG and other groups in Sheffield around the Westminster Parliamentary elections and local elections in South Yorkshire in May 2010 asked candidates to pledge their support for fundamental reforms of the Asylum and Immigration laws and practice of the U.K. These are still the key recommendations we would make   of South Yorkshire but they are among the most vulnerable people in our region. They face a difficult life here, often with prolonged uncertainty about their future. They are not allowed to work. Some receive very limited financial support in the form of inflexible vouchers or personalised within the UK have to be made personally in Croydon. Many of those seeking asylum suffer from mental and/or physical health problems, but their access to healthcare is restricted. They and their children can be detained for indefinite periods without the right of habeas corpus.  Their efforts to become integrated into this country are often frustrated by a lack of classes in English.    It is sometimes suggested that we need to treat people in this way in order to deter others from seeking asylum here. Research evidence gives no support to this argument. We should rather be guided by our regional traditions of hospitality and generosity towards those who are vulnerable.   We are asking you to pledge yourself to a more humane system by supporting the following reforms:  Grant those seeking asylum the right  to work;  Replace vouchers and azure cards with adequate cash support;  End the detention of children and seek an Inquiry into the use of detention for adults;   Give those seeking asylum full access to healthcare and to English courses;  Give adequate legal aid and enough time to make legal representations;   Allow fresh claims and submissions to be lodged with the nearest Borders Agency office and meet related travel costs.

(iii) Recommendations on state asylum procedures in the U.K. SYMAAG and other organisations supporting this submission have pressed for fundamental reform of asylum procedures and have met with the Deputy Prime Minister of the U.K. on a number of occasions (he is a Sheffield M.P.) to press for a fundamental review of asylum procedures to be independent of the enforcement agency the Home Office and the UKBA.  This fundamental review of the asylum procedures in our experience, from cases of threatened deportation we have encountered, has to include  and a reform of the way the Home Office gathers a in deciding applications.

In November 2010 the European agency FRONTEX deployed 500 border guards from various Intervention Team (RABIT) deployment. FRONTEX admitted that the majority of the migrants were from Afghanistan and Iraq, UNHCR monitoring added migrants from Iran, and Somalia to the main majority groups.The UNHCR and other rights organisations pointed out that these were the very categories of migrants who could plausibly make a case for asylum in the E.U. if they were allowed to enter. RABIT ensured few were allowed to cross the border.  Who is FRONTEX? FRONTEX (the European Agency of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the Europedirectives and policies in the area of border control, its headquarters are in Warsaw. Up to July 2010 it answered to the Orwellian titled Directorate General for Justice,Freedom and Security.The Directorate was split and FRONTEX  is now under the Directorate General for Home Affairs which interestingly covers immigration,organised crime,human trafficking and dr  The budget of the agency in 2010 was 92.8 million Euro which had increased between 2006 and 2009 by 360 % (Source FRONTEX Annual Report 2011)  What does the Agency do? In the U.K. FRONTEX is perhaps best known for its programme of mass deportation flights picking up deportees from different EU countries and flying them to various destinations which  between January and September 2010 included 35 flights with 1800 deportees to countries including Nigeria,(14) Kosovo (8) Georgia (6) Iraq (3) at a cost of  between 140,000 and 500,000 Euros per flight.The very legal basis fo these flights has been challenged  immigration regulations are based on individual cases not mass removals,or collective expulsions.The flights are often kept secret and legal representation made difficult.  What E.U. policies does FRONTEX implement? The U.K. Labour government in 1998 formally  instituted a regime for immigration and asylum  European Council summit in Tampere in October 1999 measures were formalised to   12 the E.U. Within the E.U., the policy framework within which member states operate can seem to be based on  hostility to migrants per se and a willingness to severely restrict rights to asylum. The E.U. Returns Directive adopted on 16 December 2008 aimed to produce a Europe-wide policy for regulating the treat. This directive, anti-migrant and with a focus on national interests, marks a significant shift within the politics of the -frMigrants Rights International have summed up this process    s Frontex has developed a policy of making agreements with third party countries to prevent migrants presenting themselves at E.U. borders.These agreements are based on the assumption that stopping migrants is somehow a fight against criminals..As the executive director of FRONTEX said in 2010 Countries.In a way we are all on one side of the border together and on the opposite side are the criminal organisations who are expl    In June 2010, the EU Commission and Libya signed a Memorandum of Understanding undertaking to provide EU technical assistance and cooperation for the period from 2011 to 2013. The Migration Cooperation Agenda agreed in October 2010 with Libya aimed to jointly address the challenge of managing migration and protecting refugees by offering 50 million Euros in aid to stop migrants and would-be refugees transiting through Libya on their way to Europe. Meanwhile, with the full support of the EU, Italy had negotiated two Protocols of technical and police cooperation with Libya dating back to December 2007 and aimed at combatting criminal organizations involved in the trafficking of human beings. A Partnership Treaty to strengthen mutual cooperation in various fields, signed on August 2008, and providing for a $5 billion compensation package putting an end to the dispute on claims arising from Italian colonialism, was made conditional upon a reinforcement of  financed by Italy and the European Union,and are overseen by FRONTEX in the last two years hundreds of migrants and asylum seekers intercepted at sea have been driven back to Libya without any chance of setting foot on European soil to claim asylum. The conditions these returnees were held in caused constant international outrage, confined in overcrowded detention centres where they were exploited, beaten, raped, and abused. response to the flow of migrants and refugees is so infamous and well documented that it simply cannot be the case that the EU member states are only now starting to gain an     13 Given this appalling history it is remarkable that in June  2011 Italy signed an agreement with As an E.U.  of its borders.   http://fortresseurope.blogspot.com/2006/02/immigrants-dead-at-frontiers-of-europe_16.html

The policy of making destitute thousands of asylum seekers whose asylum claims have been rejected by the United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) is contrary to their human rights under Articles 5, 14, and 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Articles 2, 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), Article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) Articles 9 and 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), Article 13 of the Revised European Social Charter (CETS No. 163). 2. The United Kingdom was a founding member of the Council of Europe and a key participant in the drafting of the European Convention on Human Rights (1953). The Convention has been very influential in the United Kingdom and its utility was a factor in the mobilisation of popular support for the introduction of domestic human rights legislation. It was fully domesticated into UK law with the passing of the Human Rights Act (1998).i ii In its 2008 UPR report the United Kingdom cited the passing of this Act as a significant measure iii 3. In regard to the socio-economic rights that are specifically relevant for the case argued in this submission it is important to note that the United Kingdom ratified in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) in 1976. Article 11 recognises the right to an adequate standard of living. In the UK and European Courts it has been almost axiomatic that a distinction should be made between civil and political rights and socio-economic rights. However, as early as 1979 the European Court has been disposed to acknowledge that no water-tight division exists between these rights.iv Despite this the UK courts have yet to vindicate socio-economic rights on the basis of ICESCR and the ECHR. 4. Acceptance of the case advanced in this UPR submission provides the international human rights community with an opportunity to enhance the utility and status of socio-economic rights and the interdependence of human rights generally. 5. The issue of enforced destitution for asylum seekers exemplifies the present gap between international human rights discourse and law and actual national practice, and the consequent need for international monitoring mechanisms for refugee law. Unlike other areas of human rights law, there appears to be no means for individuals to challenge the outcomes of national systems directly at the international level. As an extensive legal analysis concludes:  gly restrictive legal regimes which penalise them for the act of seeking asylum. Northern states, in particular, are is in operation to ensure that asylum seekers never reach the North. If they do, states have implemented punitive schemes which include detention and the removal or restriction of welfare entitlements. States are currently scrambling to make themselves appear as unattractive as possible to asylum seekers. The situation is rightly  6. obligations under international human rights conventions were extensively addressed by Amnesty International in its 2006 report. The issues have still not been resolved by the UK Government.v   THE PROBLEM: DESTITUTION  7. only 17 per cent were granted refugee status at initial decision.vi The last available estimate of the numbers of failed asylum seekers in UK by the National Audit Office (2005), was 283,500. The number is likely to have increased.vii 8. It is the experience of the Manchester and Salford groups making this submission that the overall quality of UKBA decision-making is poor. Decisions rely on crude and formulaic ubmission to explain. This view is supported by numerous independent critiques which have raised -making, the odds stacked against genuine refugees, and the pervading stilled into UKBA officials.viii the UK government to address such concerns. Asylum seekers, and the voluntary sector organisations offering them support, have lost trust in the syst---making does not allow caseworkers to reach well-reasoned decisions on individual cases.ix The -driven imperatives to -of-date, and selectively used.x These issues are compounded by the inadequate and diminishing availability of legal aid. In many cases asylum seekers have had poor or no legal representation, and most are unable to obtain it at the appeal stage.xi Drastic cuts to legal aid provision mean that asylum-seekers face Home Office officials, lawyers, and tribunal judges without representation or advice, often in a language which is not their own and without adequate translation services. The system of legal aid funding deters legal advice charities from taking the most difficult or complex cases to appeal or fresh submission.   9. The concern here is the outcome for the 75 per cent of asylum-seekers whose case is rejected. While awaiting a decision asylum seekers receive so-called Section 95 support, which consists of equal to 52 per cent of the mainstream benefit for the unemployed.xii When their case is rejected, single adults and childless couples are evicted from their accommodation and all benefits (2007) that there is a deliberate policy of reducing failed asylum seekers to destitution as a means of driving them into returning and of deterring further asylum applications: destitution has become an instrument of immigration policyxiii. 10. understood that the policy fails even within its own terms. Typically asylum-seekers have fled in extremis from civil war, inter-ethnic conflict, political or religious persecution, or widespread human rights abuses. The most frequent countries of flight are Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Somalia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Uganda, Guinea, and Zimbabwe.xiv Return means return to persecution, arbitrary violence, imprisonment, torture, or death, or, at the very least homelessness and poverty. 11. Destitution does not drive asylum-seekers into returning because destitution in the UK has become preferable to, and less life-threatening than, destitution in the country of origin.xv Moreover, in general, failed asylum-seekers do not have the resources or travel documents to return.xvi governments contest the xvii The last available Audit Commission analysis of the work of UKBA reported that the current system has not produced an increase in the number of removals, largely because of the lack of travel documents and the refusal of destination nations to recognise returnees as their own nationals. 70 per cent of forced removals are cancelled, often after lengthy detention.xviii The number of removals, rather than matching government targets, is declining. The Governxix In some cases when asylum seekers are returned they are immediately imprisoned on landing. The reality is that most failed asylum seekers are unreturnable and remain in the UK in a state of homeless and  no welfare or employment rights, and no means of support. In the words of the current multi-coalition human rights campaign, they are Still Human Still Here.xx  12. Both the failure of the policy of enforced destitution and itobligations under international human rights conventions were extensively addressed by Amnesty International in its 2006 report.xxi The issues have still not been resolved by the UK Government.     PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS 13. As an instrument of public policy the reduction of asylum-seekers to a condition of destitution crosses the threshold of inhuman and degrading treatment under Article 5 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 3 of the European Convention, and denies further rights under Articles 14, 22, and 25 of the Universal Declaration. 14. In every society there are people who become destitute through systemic injustices, unfortunate circumstances, or their own life choices or follies, but here the issue is refugees, exercising their rights under international law, and law-abiding in the UK, reduced to destitution by deliberate government policy.  15. The British Red Cross defines someone who is destitute as: g public funds, is living in extreme poverty and is unable to meet basic needs, e.g. income, food, shelter, healthcare, and who is forced to rely on irregular support from family, xxii UK legislation defines destitution as a condition in which a person does not have and cannot obtain both adequate accommodation and adequate food and other items.xxiii On either of these definitions, this is the situation to which failed asylum-seekers are reduced, as we substantiate below. 16. Right to not be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment The UK government denies its responsibility for these homeless, cashless, demoralised and vulnerable human beings on the basis of judicial rulings in UK courts which hold that withdrawal of support is not in itself an imminent breach of Article 3 of the European Convention, as incorporated into UK law by the 1998 Human Rights Act. The UKBA contention is that Article 3 is engaged only if the threshold is crossed between destitution, in the usual sense of lack of accommodation and financial means, and inhuman and degrading  a level of suffering more intense than being homeless and penniless.  17. -sponsored actions. State sponsored torture, violence, or racial discrimination, for example, would be the worst possible examples of to other forms of suffering inconsistent with their human rights, welfare, and dignity, are Asylum seekers are persons exercising their rights under international law to seek asylum. A policy of deliberately reducing them, almost immediately after their claim is refused, to a condition of homeless and penniless destitution is vulnerability and it is humiliating. The absence of recourse to legal representation exacerbates the situation.  18. The 2010 Red Cross study of destitute failed asylum-seekers found that 6 out of 10 respondents had been destitute for a year or more, some for over 5 years.xxiv The 2011 Oxfam study indicated that many have been destitute for more than 6 months and a significant proportion for more than 2 years.xxv 19. The condition asylum seekers are placed in when their claim is rejected is one no human being should be subjected to in a civilised state. We instance below in the numbered paragraphs which follow (paragraphs i to x) ways in which government policy reduces the UKBA had subjected a man suffering from mental illness to inhuman and degrading treatment in an immigration detention, detaining him unlawfully for a period of five months.xxvi 20. Right to an Adequate Standard of Living shelter and food on the goodwill and accident of friends and faith groups, and on food parcels and night shelters provided by charities and voluntary sector relief organisations. Human beings in affluent societies with developed systems of welfare for those in need are reduced to living on Red Cross food parcels. So far as its resources allow, the British Red Cross distributes food parcels to destitute asylum seekers in the UK in the same way that it responds to hunger and homelessness in humanitarian emergencies in other parts of the world: t xxvii This is a government- 21. Such dependence can lead to a complete loss of personal dignity. The Oxfam Report found such loss of human dignity particularly acute in the many asylum -seekers who are highly motivated, well educated and technically skilled. Destitution is dehumanising: asylum seekers destitution is not simply a technical or legal term to describe a lack of resources: it is about the denial of any hope for the future and the possibility of rebuilding a xxviii others stripped them of their dignity: having nothing and having to ask for everything. Many xxix 22. Many destitute individuals are not able to access sufficient provision from friends or charities and consequently suffer from real malnourishment. The problems of malnutrition associated with destitution are increasing, and sleeping rough or in abandoned or poorly heated or damp houses causes ill health.xxx 23. Failed asylum seekers have no money at all. They are literally penniless. If charitable sources do not provide resources, survival choices appear to reduce to begging, stealing, or illegal work. Failed asylum seekers lack even the money to travel to report, as required, at Immigration Reporting Centres. The Manchester Reporting Centre, Dallas Court, may be eight to ten miles distance across the city from any temporary lodging or shelter failed asylum seekers may obtain. Though required to report, sometimes daily, sometimes weekly, they are not provided with any cash for travel or any means of transportation. They must either walk, whatever the conditions, travel illegally without paying, or beg the fare.  24. Right to Liberty and Security of the Person The experience of destitution is exacerbated by the constant anxiety of reporting and the possibility of instant detention. Manchester and Salford asylum seekers face long reporting queues without shelter: heavily pregnant women have to stand in rain and snow. 25. Asylum seekers have committed no crime but are subject to administrative detention. Any attendance at an Immigration Reporting Centre may terminate in being handcuffed and transferred in a prison van to detention in quasi-prison conditions in one of thirteen Immigration Removal Centres. Detention continues for indefinite periods pending forcible deportation. Evidence recently submitted to a Parliamentary committee confirmed that considerable numbers of failed asylum seekers are detained for more than twenty nine days, some for over a year, and examples were given of over four years. In a recent case, the High Court ruled that the UKBA had subjected a man suffering from mental illness to inhuman and degrading treatment in an immigration detention, detaining him unlawfully for five months.xxxi 26. Right to Health Failed asylum seekers continue to receive NHS primary health care on a discretionary basis, i.e. if general practitioners are willing to take them, but have no entitlement to secondary (hospital) care. Failed asylum seekers who receive either Section 95 or Section 4 support and unaccompanied children are exempt for charges for secondary healthcare, but all other failed asylum seekers are chargeable, despite the fact that the vast majority will have no money. xxxii 27. Men and women who have fled torture and persecution frequently suffer from a range of mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder and disorientation. Destitute conditions and street homelessness exacerbate vulnerability and stress, create a sense of rejection and isolation, and cause further physical and mental deterioration. The combination of previous trauma with the stress of destitution can result in severe psychological distress. All research and experience shows that exclusion and destitution, after all the suffering, danger, and hope which goes with the flight of a refugee, can have a prolonged and devastating effect on individuals and cause serious mental health consequences. Hope and aspiration decline and health deteriorates. Some become suicidal. 28. Right to Work Asylum seekers are not allowed to work. This is in itself contrary to human dignity and fulfillment as formulated and guaranteed in international human rights conventions. When unable to depend on social networks or charitable resources, asylum seekers may be forced into illegal work as a survival strategy, with low pay, long hours, poor working conditions, and constant fear of UKBA raids. Illegal working means exposure to exploitation and abuse.xxxiii 29. The Right to Protection from Economic and Sexual Exploitation Research for the 2011 Oxfam Report concluded that enforced destitution creates additional vulnerability to exploitative relationships and to physical and sexual violence. xxxiv Some resort to exploitative illegal employment, working for £1-£3 an hour cash-in-hand or even less. xxxv Some enter into exploitative agreements to provide house-help, childcare, or other  forms of domestic labour in return for shelter and daily necessities.xxxvi For reasons of survival some enter relationships they would otherwise not enter and some enter transactional or coercive sexual relationships, including sex for food and cash, and prostitution. xxxvii  RECOMMENDATIONS  30. That the Home Office of the UK Government grant temporary renewable protection to asylum-seekers whose application has been rejected and who cannot return to their countries of origin. 31. That the Home Office of the UK Government grant temporary renewable protection to those asylum-seekers who are fleeing armed conflict or endemic violence, or to those who are at serious risk of systematic or generalised violations of their human rights, who are unable to establish that they are individually at risk. 32. That the UK Government, in the case of asylum-seekers whose application has been rejected and who are unable to leave the UK, permit them to remain on financial support and accommodation under Section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, or to find employment. 33. That the UK Government provide access to legal aid and legal representation to all asylum-seekers whose applications have been refused. 34. That the UK Government grant permission to obtain employment and to earn a livelihood to all asylum seekers who have been in the UK for more than six months, and to those whose application is refused and who comply with reporting instructions, but who are unable to return to their country of origin. 35. That the UK Government, in line with Recommendation 81 (b) of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrantsxxxviii, provide free access to both primary and secondary health care to all asylum-seekers, including those whose applications are refused, until removal, voluntary return, or the granting of leave to remain 36. That the UK Border Agency (UKBA) improve its decision-making procedures in determining refugee status, in line with the recommendations made to them by the UN High Commission on Refugees (July 2011).  APPENDIX Failed asylum seekUKBA, report regularly to UKBA, their movements are under UKBA control. They either cannot return or remain deeply fearful of return: return will place their lives or liberties at risk. The UK government cannot or does not return them, yet deliberately places them in a condition of penniless street destitution. The situation of failed asylum seekers in UK is well summarised in the words of the UK Joint Committee on Human Rights and by the independent social policy think-tank, the Centre for Social Justice, established by the Rt. Hon Iain Duncan Smith MP: a.  persuaded by the evidence that the government has indeed been practising a deliberate policy of destitution of this highly vulnerable group. We believe that all deliberate use of inhumane treatment is unacceptable. We have seen instances in all cases where the governm treatment of asylum seekers and refused asylum seekers falls below the requirements of the common law of humanity and international human rights law(Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights, 2007). b. Further in the report of The Centre for Social Justice we find: The evidence gathered for this report shows that the welcome offered today falls far short of our traditional standards. When persecuted people arrive in the UK they are all too often met by a bureaucratic system that treats them like cattle, does not believe their stories and spits them out to face a life of homelessness, crime, illegal working and destitution in the UK. (Centre for Social Justice). The most recent full-scale report into the condition of destitute asylum-seekers is the Oxfam Research Report, published in February 2011. The organisations comprising  c. It is not acceptable for asylum seekers to continue to live in destitution, and the government has a responsibility to ensure that the human rights of asylum seekers are upheld. The humiliating and degrading strategies adopted by destitute asylum seekers to survive and avoid deportation reflects the need for changes to government and civil-society policy and practice. All aspects of the asylum system - including the flawed asylum-determination process that often leads to wrongful denial of asylum, and policies that deny access to resources (such as the right to work and access to welfare support)  must be urgently reviewed to ensure that all asylum seekers are able to secure a sustainable and dignified livelihood. d. The survival strategies adopted by destitute asylum seekers are a consequence of asylum policy in the UK. That hundreds of thousands of people would rather live in poverty and in constant fear of deportation  reliant on friends, transactional relationships, commercial sex work or low-paid illegal work  rather than return to their country of origin, suggests the failure of government policy. The government should accept the growing body of evidence that shows that destitution does not lead refused asylum seekers to return to their country of  origin. The risks associated with continuing to pursue this approach are enormous, with significant implications for wider society. The evidence collected during the course of this research suggests the need for an entirely new policy approach  one which recognises both the human rights of asylum seekers and also their right to be human. Being human means having access to the resources needed to survive on a day-to-day basis with dignity. It also means having hope for the future. and Salford is in line with the findings and objectives of the Still Human Still Here campaign, a broad coalition of more than 40 organisations including Amnesty International, the Refugee Council, Refugee and Migrant Justice, the Migrants Rights Network, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, the Red Cross, Oxfam, Student Action for Refugees, the Boaz Trust, the Catholic Bishops Conference of England and Citizens Advice Bureau, Doctors for Human Rights, Jewish Social Action Hub, Quaker Peace and Social Witness, the Diana Princes of Wales Memorial Fund.

32,JS4 - Joint Submission 4,"IMMIGRATION DETENTION IN THE UK  Evidence submitted to the Universal Periodic review (United Kingdom) by  the Campaign to Close Campsfield (CCC) and  the Barbed Wire Britain Network to End Refugee and Migrant Detention (BWB)  www.closecampsfield.org.uk,  closecampsfield.wordpress.com  barbedwirebritain.org, barbedwirebritain.wordpress.com     1 Our main concern is the great increase in immigration detention in the UK, from some 100 places in the early 1990s to over 3,000 today. As of June 2011, the UK detention estate stood at 3,428 bed spaces. The detention estate does not include prisons, police cells  where, at any one time, hundreds of people are held under 1971 Immigration Act powers.i  2 We believe that private companies, motivated by personal financial gain, have largely driven this expansion.ii It is matter of concern that an ever-increasing proportion (currently over 75% of places) of immigration detention centres in the UK are run by companies such as GEO (Global Expertise in Outsourcing alias Wackenhutt), Kalyx (a Sodexho subsidiary), GSL (Global Solutions Ltd), Group 4/Securicor, Premier Custodial Group Ltd (a Serco subsidiary), and Mitie.  3 Our main concern is based on a conviction that it is against the human rights of those detained to lock up innocent people without charge for an indefinite period without judicial oversight and without proper reasons given in writing, and without proper access to legal representative. The increasing use of  human rights of everyone in the country.  4 None of those held in detention under Immigration Act powers is in detention because they are serving time for a custodial sentence following a criminal conviction. That is, almost all those detained are innocent of any crime. In the small minority of cases where the immigration detainee has previously been convicted of crime and paid the penalty of a prison sentence, they have already served all their prison time and should no longer be held. (It should be noted that parliament had in recent years enacted law by which it is a crito travel into, work or live in the UK without the  immigration documents approved by the government.)  5 The lack of time limit on immigration detention in the UK means that many people are detained for months, some for years: there are cases of people being detained under Immigration Act powers for up to 8 years.iii  6 Such detention without time limit (may be argued to be mental torture. We have strongly argued this in submissions to international human rights bodies.iv Medical studies by psychologists and psychiatrists support this point.v We believe human rights organisations should pay more attention to this aspect of detention.  7 A convicted criminal in the UK knows when he/she may be released. An immigration detainee does not. This is just one example of a way in which an  immigration detainee (who is innocent of any crime) is treated worse than a convicted criminal. This is wrong.  8 The UK government fails even to follow its own guidelines on detention with regard to  a) who should not be detained (victims of torture, pregnant women, children or minors are not infrequently detained) ;  b) detention being used only as a last resort (it is clear that in many cases alternatives to detention have not been properly considered: this frequently becomes clear in bail hearings or court action against the UK Boarder Agency) ; and  c) s where the Home Office argues that the person is about to be deported there is no prospect of the necessary documentation being obtained within the foreseeable future, e.g. four weeks.  9 and documented verbal and physical abuse of immigration detainees, in detention and particularly during deportation. The family of Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan who died at the hands of private company G4S guards on board a British Airways flight at Heathrow last year, is still seeking justice: neither the company nor individuals have been charged with a criminal offence. An extensive dossier on physical abuse and assaults on deportees and detainees was published in 2008.vi  10 In detention in the UK, detainees are pressurised (through boredom, financial incentive, seeking to please authorities) to work for 50 pence an hour in kitchen, cleaning and other jobs in the detention centre. This cynical cost-cutting UK Minimum Wage law, and is a gross exploitation of people who are in a very vulnerable situation. The practice has been condemned by trade union and other organsiations in the UK.vii  11 Until a detainee has his/her immigration status resolved or asylum application finalized, there is only one way he/she can obtain their natural at an immigration bail hearing in one of the 12 courts across the UK of the First Tier of the Tribunals Service (Immigration and Asylum) that the Home Office is not justified in detaining him/her. Extensive studies have shown that these bail hearings amount in many case to no more than a travesty of justice.viii   12 immigration  (who faces much lower entrance  qualification requirements than for judges in other courts of the UK) is often seen not to be impartial, the Home Office representative being treated leniently while the bail applicant (the detainee) is frequently not properly treated. This is well documented in the study Immigration Bail Hearings: A Travesty of Justice referred to in the note above. The following is the account t of one detainee of his bail hearing:   ment of the profession that gives no room for any partiality between the contending parties. He addresses me uncaring of  the consequences of his utterances. The hatred he has for me was so manifest. He was blunt in his approach and he was openly prejudiced towards me. I felt so humiliated by his actions.   judicial review claims and get on the plane to Nigeria if I do not want to conhe could not help my situation unless I help myself by getting on the plane to Nigeria. He never commented on my medications and condition in particular but concluded that the onus is on me to save    (Extract of complaint from Abiola Ayobola, 28 July 2011, then a  detainee at Campsfield House, about his bail hearing held via video  link.)  13 In June 2010 the incoming coalition government of the UK promised to end detention of children. This has not happened. It obviously should. But in September 2011 the government opened a new family and children detention centre at Pease Pottage in Sussexix  14 There are serious concerns about the quality of medical care available to immigration detainees. Access to health care in detention centres is subject to considerations of profit, which is not the case for the general public in the UK and should not be for those in detention.  15 It not only in the UK but in EU and buffer countries to the east and on North Africa is not only unjust but unsustainable. Serious attention to the above concerns will show that to be the case.   16 Quite apart from the above, which we trust the Universal Periodical Review will address, the Campaign to Close Campsfield also believes that the following is necessary: Close Campsfield, other detention centres, and detention wings in prisons;  Stop immigration detentions and imprisonment;  Stop racist deportations;  Repeal immigration laws which reinforce racism.   20 November 2011                                            NOTES  i Website of Freemovement, 4 June 2011.  ii Christine Bacon (2005) The Evolution of Immigration Detention in the UK: The Involvement of Private Prison Companies, working paper 27, Refugee Studies Centre Oxford  iii Detained Lives: The real cost of indefinite immigration detention, London Detainee Support Group, 2009.  iv Causing Mental Illness Is Cruel and Inhuman Treatment, submission to the Degrading Treatment or Punishment, from Barbed Wire Britain Network to End Refugee and Migrant Detention, September 2008.  v 1.

33,JS5 - Joint Submission 5,"   Joint NGO submission related to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for 13th Universal Periodic Review session scheduled for May-June 2012 CASTE-BASED DISCRIMINATION IN THE UK Submitted by the Dalit Solidarity Network UK and the International Dalit Solidarity Network  21 November 2011         DALIT SOLIDARITY NETWORK UK    The Dalit Solidarity network (DSN-UK) is a network of nearly 100 individuals, Dalit community organisations, faith bodies and international NGOs. Members include CasteWatch UK in Coventry, Association for Community Cohesion in London and the Federation of Ambedkarite and Buddhist Organisations UK (FABO).i International NGO supporters include Minority Rights Group International and Anti Slavery International. DSN-UK works alongside the Anti Caste Discrimination Alliance (ACDA) and is hosted by the Methodist Church in London. The DSN-UK Director coordinates a recently formed All Party Parliamentary Group for Dalits in the UK. Website: www.dsnuk.org The International Dalit Solidarity Network (IDSN) is an international network that works on a global level for the elimination of caste discrimination and similar forms of discrimination based on work and descent. Members include national Dalit platforms in caste-affected countries, Dalit Solidarity Networks in seven European countries, and international associates among others. Website: www.idsn.org   1  Joint NGO submission by the Dalit Solidarity Network UK and the International Dalit Solidarity Network related to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for 13th Universal Periodic Review session scheduled for May-June 2012 I. Executive summary 1. This report is prepared jointly by the Dalit Solidarity Network UK (DSN-UK) and the International Dalit Solidarity Network (IDSN) for the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) at the 13th session in the second UPR cycle.  The report focuses specifically on caste-based discrimination in the UK, where an estimated 250.000 Dalits live. It draws on the findings of independent research reports, studies, cases, and recommendations of the UN human rights bodies.ii  2. treaties, universal human rights standards, and voluntary commitments on human rights. In resolution A/HRC/RES/16/21 the Human Rights Council decided that the second and subsequent cycles of the review should focus on, inter alia, the implementation of the accepted recommendations and the developments of the human rights situation in the State under Review (SuR). This report is prepared in accordance with these guidelines and will therefore include information about developments in the SuR in relation to the process to prohibit caste discrimination in the UK since the first review (section II). Information on the implementation of human rights will be considered in section III, followed by recommendations and questions to be asked in the interactive dialogue. II. Developments in the UK Prohibiting caste discrimination in the UK 3. Since the first review of the UK in April 2008, an increasing number of reports and cases have demonstrated the fact that caste discrimination exists in the country and needs to be outlawed. Furthermore, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) has recommended the UK Government to prohibit caste discrimination in 2003 and 2011. Despite clear evidence and growing pressure from the public and political sphere over the last years, the Government has hesitated to take any decision on whether or not to outlaw caste discrimination in the UK. 4. Despite evidence that caste discrimination exists in the UK, the Government is still reticent to invoke the clause outlawing caste discrimination in national legislation. In 2005 the Labour Government announced a two-a new Single Equality Act. The Single Equality Act was to consolidate and harmonise a complex raft of equality legislation prohibiting discrimination on various grounds.iii discriminatory characteristic in the Single Equality Bill. In 2010 the Government responded to this pressure and decided to investigate the problem further. At a historic meeting in the House of Lords on 4 February, it was decided to amend section 9(5)(a) in the Equality Act 2010 so as to provide for caste to be an aspect of . The decision allowed the introduction of secondary legislation by order of a Minister, if there was evidence of caste discrimination in the UK. The Government therefore commissioned independent research in March 2010 to assess the existence the caste-based discrimination; the nature, extent and severity of caste prejudice, discrimination and harassment in Britain; and the implications for Government policy before enforcing the amendment.  5. The study, which was published in December 2010, concluded that the current provisions in the Equality Act 2010 would not sufficiently cover caste discrimination and harassment as effectively as caste-specific provisions would. The report recommended that ""extending the definition of race to include caste would provide further, explicit protection"" and that -legislative approaches are less likely to be effective in the private sector and do not assist those where the authorities themselves are discriminating. Relying on the Indian community to take action to reduce caste discrimination and harassment is problematiciv   2  III. Promotion and protection of human rights on the ground: implementation of international human rights and national legislation  Caste discrimination in the UK 6. Evidence shows that caste discrimination manifests itself in different forms in the UK. Dalits face discrimination in the sectors of employment, healthcare, education, provision of goods and services and politics, and in access to Hindu temples.v While individuals of Dalit origin and their descendants no longer pursue the culture-nd indirect discrimination in the UK (as per completion of this report in end November 2011). 7. The -UK in 2006 was the first national study to document the problem, and it found that one in every two Dalits identified themselves and were identified by their caste. Caste groups maintain their communities intact due to traditionally arranged marriages within particular castes, which have led to the continuation and development of communities along strict caste lines. Many of the respondents in the study observed that within the Indian community, caste is their identity. 85% felt that Indians actively practiced and participated in the caste system. The study furthermore documented that ancestry is identified in a number of ways, including on the basis of name (although worship, education, social circle and on the basis of community knowledge.  8. Caste remains invisible in much of British society, but steps out from the shadows when a marriage is arranged, a child is born, or a new professional or business opportunity emerges in the Indian Diaspora community. In a recent court case, an Indian couple became become thdiscrimination, saying they were forced from their jobs following their marriage.vi The couple, who belong to different caste groups, has claimed unfair constructive dismissal and cited caste discrimination as the grounds in a case, which was first heard at the Employment Tribunal in August 2011. The 10 day hearing ended with the tribunal judge re-listing the case for a further 15 days  now scheduled for March 2012. 9. Discrimination on the grounds of caste remains outside existing anti-discrimination provisions in the UK. In 2010 a study was undertaken by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) with the purpose to identify whether caste discrimination and harassment exists in relation to aspects covered by the UK Equality Act 2010, i.e. employment, education and the provision of goods and services.vii The report concluded that evidence of caste discrimination and harassment of the type covered by the Act in relation to work (bullying, recruitment, promotion, task allocation); provision of services; and education (pupil on pupil bullying) exists.viii The study also identified evidence suggesting caste discrimination and prejudice which may fall outside the Equality Act 2010 in relation to voluntary work, harassment, demeaning behaviour, and violence. The Government has yet to respond to the findings of the commissioned report, although they have had considerable time to do so. 10. At a meeting at the House of Lords in January 2011 the Minister for Equalities, Lynne Featherstone MP November 2011, 11 months after the Report was published there has been no response. 11. Several other studies and scholars have investigated the problems of caste discrimination in the UK. It has been estimated that at least 250,000 Dalits live in the UK, but the exact number is unknown. The absence of data points to the need for introducing detailed research by the government and disaggregated data in any future census. UK response to recommendations by UN human rights mechanisms 12. UN human rights bodies have on a number of occasions addressed the issue of caste discrimination in the UK, calling for the UK Government to amend its legislation, including the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial   3  discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. 13. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) has twice recommended the UK Government to enact a prohibition against caste discrimination in 2003 and in 2011 to invoke Clause9(5)(a) of the Equality Act, recalling CERD General Recommendation 29 on ""descent"" in article 1(1) of the Convention (2002). In this General Recommendation, the Committee reaffirms that descent-based discrimination encompass discrimination on the basis of caste and analogous systems of inherited status as a violation of the Convention.ix In the 2003 Concluding Observations, the Committee recommends the UK Government that a prohibition against such discrimination be included in domestic legislationrequests information on this issue in the next periodic report. 14. recommendation from 2003 but does not provide any substantial information as requested by the Committee. During the 2011 review of the UK Government at the 79th CERD session, the UK delegation said had not yet taken a decision on the findings of the government-commissioned report from 2010.  15. In conclusion of this review, CERD called on the State party to prohibit caste discrimination in the Concluding Observations issued at its 79th session (CERD/C/GCR/CO/18-20): . While noting the assertion of the State party that there is no evidence in the State party of the existence of caste-based discrimination to any significant extent in the fields covered by the Convention, the Committee has received information from nongovernmental organizations and from recent research studies commissioned by State party institutions that such discrimination and harassment in violation of the rights to work, to education and to the supply of goods and services does exist in the State party (article 2). Recalling its previous concluding observations (CERD/C/63/CO/11 para. 25) and its General Recommendation 29 (2002) on descent, the Committee recommends that the Minister responsible in the State party invoke section 9(5)(a) of the Equality ACommittee further requests the State party to inform the Committee of developments on this matter in its next periodic report 16. Furthermore both the UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism and the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights have taken note of the existence of discrimination on the basis of work and descent  the UN terminology for caste discrimination  in the UK diaspora communities. In his annual report to the Human Rights Council in June 2011 (A/HRC/17/40), the UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism identified amendment of the UK Equality Act 2010 to enact specific legislation to outlaw direct and indirect discrimination against affected groups in accordance with the general measures contained in CERD General Recommendation 29. 17. In an expanded working paper, made by two experts of the former UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 2004 (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2004/31), it is noted that discrimination based on work and descent continues, to a greater or lesser extent, to affect diaspora communities whose original cultures and traditions include aspects of inherited social exclusion. In the UK, this relates to intermarriage between castes, commensality (i.e. the act or practice of eating/drinking together), access to places of worship, employment conditions, discrimination in access to political participation, and the role of the media.     4  IV. Implementation of accepted UPR recommendations  18. In the course of the Universal Periodic Review of the UK in 2008, the issue of caste discrimination was not specifically raised. In the Report of the Working Group (A/HRC/8/25), one accepted recommendation is relevant in this context, i.e. no. 23 by Egypt: 23. To enhance the programmes aimed at addressing socio-economic inequalities, from a human rights perspective in fulfilment of its obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. (Egypt) 19. recommendation and states that it has implemented it, and will keep the matter under review.  20. As a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the UK Government is responsible for preventing and addressing caste discrimination which constitutes a violation of article 2 of the Covenant, as affirmed in CESCR General Comment No. 20 on Non-Discrimination in Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.x In the General Comment, the Committee reaffirms that the prohibited ground of birth (para. 2.2. of the ICESCR) includes descent, especially on the basis of caste and analogous systems of inherited status.  21. DSN-UK and IDSN recommend the UK Government to take immediate steps to prevent, prohibit and eliminate caste-based discriminatory practices and act against dissemination of ideas of superiority and inferiority on the basis of caste in fulfilment of its obligations under the ICESCR, as recognized in CESCR General Comment No. 20. The UK Government should immediately invoke Clause 9(5)(a) of the Equality Act to legislate for  prohibition against caste discrimination, as recommended by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) in 2003 and 2011,xi in order to effective address socio-economic equalities and discrimination based on caste. 22. The UK Government should develop and put into action a comprehensive national strategy and enact affirmative action programmes to educate the general public on the situation of victims of caste-based discrimination, including the law against caste discrimination when adopted, targeting the judiciary, schools, work places, the public sector, etc. V. Overall recommendations  23. The Government should, without further delay, trigger the power already included in the Equality Act 2010 in accordance with its obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), and as recommended by CERD Committee in their review of the UK in August 2011. 24. The Government has had considerable time to consider the findings of the commissioned report and give a -based discrimination exist in the UK. The continuing delays by the Government ignore the sufferings and abuse of people in the UK who experience caste discrimination and go against the will of the UK Parliament, which has declared caste discrimination to be unacceptable. More specifically, DSN-UK and IDSN therefore recommend the following: a. The UK Government should, without any further hesitation, immediately adopt the amendment to prohibit caste discrimination in the Equality Act 2010 in accordance with its international obligations under the ICERD, and as specifically recommended by CERD in 2003 and 2011.xii b. The UK Government should put into action a comprehensive national strategy with the participation of members of affected communities to eliminate caste discrimination, in accordance with the provisions in CERD General Recommendation 29. c. The UK Government should take steps to identify caste-based communities under their jurisdiction who suffer from caste discrimination and include caste-based data in any future census, in accordance with CERD General Recommendation 29.   5  d. The UK Government should conduct periodic surveys on the reality of caste-based discrimination and provide disaggregated information in their reports to the Committee on the geographical distribution and economic and social conditions of caste-based communities, including a gender perspective, in accordance with CERD General Recommendation 29. e. The UK Government should endorse the Draft UN Principles and Guidelines on the effective elimination of discrimination based on work and descent as a guiding framework on how to comprehensively address caste discrimination.xiii VI. List of questions to be asked in the interactive dialogue 25. The following questions may be asked in the interactive dialogue: a. What concrete steps does the Government plan to take to invoke section 9(5)(a) of the Equality Act n order to provide remedies to victims of this form of discrimination as recommended by CERD in 2011? xiv b. Does the UK Government plan to adopt any special measures in favour of caste-based groups and communities in order to ensure their enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with CERD General Recommendation 29 on descent and CERD General Recommendation 32 on special measures? c. How does the UK Government intend to use, follow up, and disseminate information on the findings and conclusions of the Government-commissioned study? d. How does the UK Government intend to ensure a regular and meaningful dialogue with stakeholders in the future?  5.                                                                  1. i In January 2009 report The 'Evil of Caste' by the late Mr. Chanan Chahal, Chairman FABO, UK was published in association with DSN-UK and launched in the House of Commons. 2. ii See Annex 1 for a list of references 3. iii A table of the protected characteristics and issues covered by the Equality Act can be found on: http://www.equality.salford.ac.uk/cms/resources/uploads/File/equality_act/equality-act-2010-briefing%20just%20table.pdf  4. iv  by Hilary Metcalf and Heather Rolfe, National Institute of Economic and Social Research, p. 65 published December 2010 5. v Savio Lourdu Mahimaidass & Dr Nidhi Sadana, No Escape: Caste Discrimination in the UK, Dalit Solidarity Network UK Report.

34,JS6 - Joint Submission 6,"1   UPR Submission on access to safe and legal abortion in Northern Ireland (part of the UK) 13th Session of the Universal Periodic Review  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland - June 2012    Joint Submission by:  Family Planning Association (FPA) www.fpa.org.uk  &  The Sexual Rights Initiative (SRI)                  2  Key Words: Abortion; Rape; Women; Health; Discrimination   Introduction  1. This report is submitted by the Family Planning Association (FPA)1 and the Sexual Rights Initiative (SRI)2. It contends that the UK Government has legislation in place that is incompatible with international human rights obligations because women living in Northern Ireland are denied access to safe and legal abortions.  This is a violation of their rights to health, non-discrimination, privacy, life, liberty and security of the person and to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment. The consequence is that women are still at risk of unsafe abortion practices and are unable to access abortions safely and legally if they have been raped, are a victim of incest or have a diagnosis of fetal abnormality.     Background and context  2. Northern Ireland, although part of the UK, operates under a different legal framework in relation to abortion than England, Scotland and Wales. Abortion is only legal in extremely restrictive circumstances with a very small number of abortions carried out each year, with only 75 legal abortions in the year 2010 -20113. Fetal abnormality, fetal viability, rape and/or incest are not grounds for an abortion.  3. Women not entitled to an abortion in Northern Ireland are forced to travel to England or another European country. Despite being UK citizens, they are not entitled to a National Health Service (NHS) abortion (unlike women from the rest of the UK), and dAbortion therefore becomes a class issue, only available to those who can afford it. According to recorded statistics, since 1970, over 56,9304 women living in Northern Ireland have paid for a private abortion in England. This statistic is based on addresses provided by women but many, for fear of detection, give false addresses; therefore it is generally accepted that this is an underestimation. Those women who cannot afford to access abortion services in England are either forced into motherhood or unsafe abortion practices.                                                              1 FPA is tuman rights in relation to sexual and reproductive health. FPA provides the only non-directive, non-judgmental unplanned pregnancy counselling, information and support service in Northern Ireland and has over twenty years experience of working with women with unplanned and crisis pregnancies. 2 A coalition including: Action Canada for Population and Development (ACPD); Creating Resources for Empowerment and Action (India), AKAHATA (Latin America), Federation for Women and Family Planning (Poland), and others. 3 Source: Hospital Inpatient System 4 1970 - 1973 - Wales Supplement; 1974  2001 - Office for National Statistics Abortion Statistics Series AB; 2002 - 2010 - Department of Health Abortion Statistics Statistical Bulletin.  3  Legislative framework   4. Abortion legislation which permits abortions to be carried out for a wider range of circumstances (including for grounds of rape, incest and fetal abnormality) introduced to England, Scotland and Wales in 1967, has never been extended to Northern Ireland.  Abortion in England, Scotland and Wales is state-funded and provided by the National Health Service, at no financial cost to women.    5. In Northern Ireland abortion remains under the provision of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which states that procuring or assisting in an abortion is a criminal offence punishable by up to life imprisonment. Thus, abortion is criminalised in health.  Political context    6. In 1967, there was a devolved parliament in Northern Ireland and the decision to enact the same permissive abortion legislation introduced in the rest of the UK was left to the Northern Ireland parliament. They opposed inclusion in the Act. With the onset of land parliament was dissolved and constitutional power returned to Westminster, with permissive abortion legislation never being extended to Northern Ireland.   7.  The Northern Ireland Assembly was established under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 and is now the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland. It has responsibility for significant areas of policy, apart from those specifically under the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of the UK.  At this point in time, responsibility for abortion legislation remained with the UK Government.  8. Under the devolution of Policing and Justice in 2010, responsibility for abortion was devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly because is still governed by criminal legislation. It is significant to note that abortion remains under the legislative jurisdiction of the UK Government with regards to Wales and Scotland, who also have devolved parliaments.  Thus, Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where abortion is still criminalised.  9. All three devolved assemblies (Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly) can pass primary legislation within the areas that have been devolved to them, but their powers to legislate all stem from the UK Parliament and can be withdrawn unilaterally. For example the Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended on several occasions due to political deadlocks,  10.  The doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty means that the UK Government can legislate on all matters including matters that have been devolved.  Therefore, the UK Government has the ultimate responsibility for abortion legislation in Northern Ireland.  4  Such legislation cannot be challenged in the courts, while legislation passed by the three devolved legislatures can be withdrawn by the UK Government if it is found to overstep their powers5.   Failure of the UK Government to meet international human rights obligations  11. The UK Government has overall responsibility for ensuring that all jurisdictions of the UK, including Northern Ireland, meet obligations with regard to international conventions and treaties.  However there have been serious lapses in the discharge of this legal responsibility giving rise to persistent inequalities and grave and systematic violations of the human rights of women living in Northern Ireland including breaches of  obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW); the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR;) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  12. In 2008, the CEDAW Committee noted with concern that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women is unevenly applied across all jurisdictions of the UK. The Committee stressed that the primary responsibility for implementing the Convention in all jurisdictions rests with the UK Government and that a comprehensive and overarching national strategy for the implementation of the Convention should be developed.6   13. incongruous position on abortion and made the following recommendations to the UK Government:  A process of public consultation on abortion should be initiated.  Abortion law should be amended so as to remove punitive provisions imposed on women who undergo abortion.  Health services should be delivered in a gender-sensitive manner to all health concerns of women.7  14. These concerns were further validated by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), who in their concluding observations made the following recommendation: The Committee calls upon the State party to amend the abortion law of Northern Ireland to bring it in line with the 1967 Abortion Act with a view to preventing clandestine and unsafe abortions in cases of rape, incest or foetal abnormality.8                                                            5 Whilst the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty exists there is a parliamentary convention that the UK Government will not legislate in a devolved area without the consent of the devolved government  nonetheless the doctrine still exists. 6 Concluding Observations of CEDAW regarding: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 18 July 2008, C/GBR/CO/6, at para 16. 7Ibid, at paras. 41 and 42.  5   15. To date the UK Government has ignored the concerns and recommendations of UN bodies and has made no attempt to ensure compliance with its international human rights obligations in Northern Ireland, as detailed below.    The Right to Health  16. The abortion law in Northern Ireland criminalises women restricting their access to abortion, and serves as an impermissible barrier to the realisation of the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health under article 12.1 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Women living in Northern Ireland are still exposed to the health risks of unsafe abortions and do not have safe and affordable access to high quality abortion services.  17. Women who decide for reasons of fetal abnormality to have an abortion have to travel to England and pay £2000 (2283) for the abortion procedure. Normal clinical practice is for women to receive a two-step abortion procedure which includes the administration of a potassium chloride injection followed by expulsion of the fetus.  However, the Royal College of Midwives has noted with an ever increasing concern that women are only receiving the first stage of the procedure in England and are presenting themselves at maternity units in Northern Ireland expecting delivery.9 The College notes that ng been carried out she is at risk of developing the complications associated with carrying a dead fetus Women living in the rest of the UK are not subjected to these health risks as they receive both stages of the procedure without the same delay.  18. The extreme restrictive provision of abortion in Northern Ireland has resulted in women who are unable or cannot afford to travel to England or another European country, resorting to accessing abortifacient medicines available online. The FPA helpline in Northern Ireland has been increasingly receiving calls from distressed women considering buying such medicine even though upon the interpretation of the law in Northern Ireland, they would be acting illegally. Some women attempting to access abortifacient medicine online access rogue internet sites and are supplied with incomplete prescriptions. They have no way of knowing what they are taking, or if they are taking the correct dosage. Women are not only putting their lives at risk but are also risking prosecution and could be charged with the criminal offence of unlawfully procuring a miscarriage, which carries a sentence of life imprisonment.    19. Due to the criminalisation of abortion in Northern Ireland, there is little or no education and training available for health professionals responsible for delivering post                                                                                                                                                                                             8 Concluding Observations of CESCR regarding: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 22 May 2009, E/C.12/GBR/CO/5, at para 25. 9 Letter to Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, dated 2 December 2008.  6  abortion care with services not meeting clinical practice recommendations set by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG).10 The lack of training available to clinicians can result in invasive procedures which with proper training would have been avoided.   The Right to Non-Discrimination   20. The denial of safe and legal abortion services in Northern Ireland, as a health service required exclusively by women, is discriminatory and consequently in violation of article 2 of the CEDAW Convention which provides for equal entitlement to health care and more broadly for equal protection of the law.   21. It is discriminatory for a State party to refuse to legally provide reproductive health services for women.11 By excluding Northern Ireland from the 1967 Abortion Act, the State party has not only failed to provide equal entitlement to healthcare but has singled out and criminalised healthcare that only women need and exposed them to health risks that are not experienced by men. Men living in Northern Ireland are currently able to access all health services they need without stigma, legal barriers, or the threat of criminal punishment, whereas women cannot.   22. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where abortion is still criminalised in the majority of circumstances. As a result, the UK Government has failed to ensure that women living in Northern Ireland have the same legal rights to access free, safe and legal abortions as women in other parts of the UK.   The Right to Privacy  23. Women living in Northern Ireland do not have adequate protection of their right to privacy under article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The decision to have an abortion is a private decision and in a free and democratic society the conscience of the individual must be paramount to that of the state. By imposing arbitrary restrictions on access to abortion, women are denied their freedom of conscience, and are deprived of their essential humanity.    The Right to Life  24. The Human Rights Committee General Comment No. 28 on equality of rights between men and women, asks State Parties, when reporting on the right to life protectState to help women prevent unwanted pregnancies, and to ensure that they do not                                                            10 Evaluation of Post Abortion Care Services in Northern Ireland. November 2008. Dr Kelly Eastwood. Eastern Health and Social Services Board. 11 General Recommendation No.24 (20th session, 1999), Article 12: Women and Health, para. 11.  7  have to undergo life-12 FPA knows through its helpline and the other services it provides that many women in Northern Ireland since 1968 have engaged in unsafe abortion practices, and that women regularly put their health and lives at risk. Since the 1967 Abortion Act was introduced in the rest of the UK there have been five known deaths due to illegal, unsafe abortions in Northern Ireland.  25. General Comment No. 28 also considers laws or policies where States impose a legal duty upon health professionals to report cases of women who have undergone illegal abortions, a potential violation of the right to life and the right torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 7 of ICCPR).  Section 5 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 places a duty and legal obligation on all citizenfor women who encounter medical complications from self-administered abortions if they seek medical assistance as the health professional would have a legal obligation to report them to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. FPA knows from its counselling service that some women choose not to disclose that they have had an illegal abortion to a health professional for fear of potential prosecution. This can be dangerous, as the healthcare professional involved may not give the proper medical treatment without full   The Right to Liberty and Security of the Person   26. The right to liberty and security of the person is protected by article 9 of the ICCPR. The right to liberty affords every individual a degree of personal autonomy over important decisions intimately affecting his or her own private life. Forcing a woman, by threat of criminal prosecution, to carry a fetus to full term unless she meets restrictive legal criteria unrelated to her personal circumstances and priorities, is an interference with a woman's body and an infringement of security of the person.   27. Women who do not meet the restrictive legal criteria for an abortion, are told that they cannot submit to a safe medical procedure that might be of clear benefit to them. Not only does the removal of decision-making power threaten women physically; the indecision of not knowing whether an abortion will be granted inflicts great emotional stress for the women involved.  This emotional stress is further compounded by the fact that women who decide to have an abortion are forced to travel to England or another European country, often in clandestine circumstances, which can affect their future health and wellbeing. Due to the culture of secrecy that exists in Northern Ireland, the abortion law carries with it the social demand that women should keep the fact that they had an abortion a secret, or at the very least, that they should be extremely cautious about whom they tell.                                                              12 HRC, General Comment No. 28: Article 3 (Equality of rights between men and women), in Compilation of General Comments supra n. 32 at 179, para. 10.   8  28. For those women who cannot afford to pay for the abortion procedure in England or another European country and do not access unsafe illegal abortions; they are left with little option but to continue with the pregnancy. These women are forced to continue a pregnancy against their will and face the possibility of developing a pregnancy related illness or condition such as gestational diabetes, hyper-tension or pre-eclampsia.  Restricting access to abortion in order to promote the birth of a fetus subordinates the security of the person to this objective.   The right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment  29.  The Human Rights Committee has stated that denial of abortions to women with diagnoses of fetal abnormality violates Article 7 of the ICCPR. Being forced to continue a pregnancy against their will where there is fetal abnormality present can cause mental distress that is preventable; thus constituting inhuman and degrading treatment.13 The Committee has further addressed abortion in the context of rape, as a violation of the right to be free from inhuman or degrading treatment in General Comment No. 28. States Parties are required to report on whether they provide safe access to abortion for women who become pregnant as a result of rape, to enable the Committee to assess their compliance with Article 7.14 Rape and fetal abnormality are not grounds for legal abortions in Northern Ireland; therefore the UK Government is in violation of Article 7 of the ICCPR.  Recommendations  30. The UK Government should ensure that women who are legally entitled to an abortion in Northern Ireland are provided with the service.  31. The UK Government should ensure post abortion aftercare services in Northern Ireland meet clinical practice standards by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG).  32. The UK Government should remove the financial hardship placed on women living in Northern Ireland by providing free National Health Service (NHS) abortions in all parts of the UK.  33. The UK Government should eliminate the risk of unsafe abortions, by repealing the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act and enact legislation that:  removes criminal sanctions for women who have illegal abortions;  is non-discriminatory to women;  and provides for abortions to be carried out for grounds of rape, incest and fetal abnormality.                                                               13 KL v Peru (1153/2003), CCPR/C/85/D/1153/2003 (2005); 13 IHRR 355 (2006), at para 6.3. 14 HRC General Comment No. 28, supra n.10 at para.11.

It is affiliated to FIACAT (International Federation of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture). FIACAT is an International Non Governmental Organisation for the defence of Human Rights which figths for the abolition of torture and the deah penalty.   2 1. Pre-charge detention   The Home Office published its findings and recommendations following the Review of Counter Terrorism and Security Powers on 21 January 2011. The key recommendation was the reduction in the number of days, an individual suspected of terrorism can be held in pre-charge detention. On 25 January 2011 the maximum limit of pre-charge detention reverted to 14 days from 28 days.  The Home Office then published the Protection of Freedom bill, setting out these new changes and eliminating the power to extend the period by executive order - any new extension could only be made by legislative amendment.   On 11 February 2011 the UK Home Office then published the Draft Detention of Terrorism Suspects Bill which would provide contingency powers to extend the number of days of pre-charge detention back to 28 days.  This would only be in response to an undefined urgent situation where 14 days was considered not sufficiently long.   The Joint Committee on Draft Detention of Terrorist Suspects was appointed to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny of the bill2.  There has been considerable criticism of the Government plans in this Committee.   ACAT UK has very serious reservations concerning the draft bill. The 14 day pre-detention charge is too long - much, longer than in other similar democratic countries. It would be difficult to set out what would be an emergency, what specific and detailed circumstances would need to be in place and how these would be measured before contingency powers were invoked.     ACAT UK fears that no information has been included regarding any specific and detailed circumstances which would result in the invoking of the 28 day pre-charge detention.  This gives the Government carte blanche in effect.  The Protection of Freedom Bill has been passed by the House of Commons and also passed its second reading in the House of Lords on 8 November 2011. It now goes to a Third Reading, committee stage and also a report stage.  It is estimated that it will receive the royal assent in May 2012.   2  The Ministry of Justice now has sole responsibility for youth justice and has set up the Youth Justice Policy Unit. In October 2010 the Government announced the abolition of the Youth Justice Board set up in 1998 as part of the Government proposals to scrap 192 quangos.   On 23 June 2011 the Minister of Justice announced that the responsibilities of the Board would be transferred to the Ministry of Justice  the head of the Board would lead the new specialist body, Youth Justice Division. There was very considerable opposition to the abolition, especially in the House of Lords. The Minister argued that there had been significant improvements in youth justice and a separate body providing oversight of the                                                  2 It is composed of peers and members of the House of Lords and chaired by Lord Armstrong.   3 youth justice system was no longer needed. Ministers would now be responsible for youth justice and would be better able to influence policy.  The Report by Peter Smallridge and Andrew Williamson of a Review of the Use of Restraint in Juvenile Secure Settings, late 2008, found that there had been a growth in the use of unauthorised restraint techniques in Secure Training Centres.  Following this report, a Restraint Accreditation Board was due to be established to advise on the methods of restraint, accredited for use in secure custody. They recommended that experts should be drawn from a range of disciplines including physiotherapists, paediatrics, child psychiatry, orthopaedics together with those with working knowledge of restraints. The Report stated that there was no such thing as an entirely safe restraint and that restraint should only be used within an approved system and only as a last resort, with the minimum force required to prevent harm. There are 4 Secure Training Centres, run by private security companies  Hassockfield, Medway, Oakhill and Rainsbrook. There have been concerns that in some instances staff have not been fully trained to deal with difficult children with a multitude of problems.  The Government is now in the process of devising a single method of restraint to be called the Conflict Resolution Technique. The Government persists in retaining the defence of Centres and Youth Offenders.    There are strict limits regarding the circumstances where force may be used  the Court of Appeal has held that the use of force to maintain order and discipline is unlawful. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has held that the use of reasonable restraint must not involve the deliberate infliction of pain as a form of control.  There are now two most common methods of restraint  physical control in care (PCC).  C & R is used in Young Offenders Institutions but is designed for adults and is a pain compliant technique to be used with a minimum of 3 staff. PCC is used in secure training centres and is non-pain compliant except when it becomes necessary to   The use of nose distraction technique was permanently withdrawn at the end of 2008 but nose control is still permitted in youth offender institutions where about 86 % of children are remand or serving a custodial sentence. It is held to be no different from the nose distraction technique and can be very painful.  The Government has set aside funding for an accelerated programme of training for staff working with young people and for CCTV (Closed Circuit Television) in common areas in Secure Training Centres and privately owned young offender institutions; this will be used to monitor the use of restraint. A panel of medical experts will access the safety and accredit all restraint techniques. These measures may now well bee the subject of financial cuts.  The secure training centres are run by privately owned security firms, including Serco, C4S  it is important that the Government puts into effect its commitment to ensure that all staff are adequately vetted for their suitability for work with children in the criminal justice system, are fully trained and required to attend refresher courses at regular intervals.    4 In January 2011 the second inquest into the death of 14 year old Adam Rickwood at Hassockfeld Secure Training Centre was held. The jury found that before his death in 2004, there was a serious failure in relation to the use of restraint, giving rise to an unlawful regime.  The use of restraint was a contributing factor in his death.  ACAT UK considers:  It is a matter of priority that measures are taken immediately to ensure that all staff working with children in such centres are carefully vetted and fully trained;  It is important that all necessary measures are taken to ensure that each child in a secure training centre has access to an independent person who can take up complaints on their behalf and also provide emotional support;  It is vitally important that a Restraint Accreditation Board is established without delay with experts drawn from a wide range of disciplines;  Immediate action should be taken to evaluate and assess behavioural techniques, which when introduced would result in the ending of physical restraint;  The Government should look at alternatives to the incarceration of children, sometimes as young as 12, in secure training centres.    3. The use of Tasers and peper sprays   It is argued that Tasers provide a safer and less lethal alternative to the use of handguns by the police in certain situations. But it is known that the use of Tasers can significantly increase the risk of cardiac arrest or death, or other problems, when used on those with certain medical conditions. Tree men died during a period of 8 days in August 2011 - a 53 year old tasered at his home in Bolton, a 25 year old restrained using pepper spray in Widnes and a 27 year old tasered several times in Cumbria and also subjected to pepper spray.  When first introduced, small numbers of Authorised Fire Officers in the various police forces were given a few hours training in the use of Tasers. Subsequently, more officers have been given permission to use them, often without proper training. It appears that Tasers are now used in many forces as a matter of routine when dealing with difficult situations. A Taser was used by police at close range for example, during the forcible removal of residents and causing many protests.    or serious injury or where a situation was considered to cause danger to the public, the Independent Police Complaints Commission begins an investigation.      ACAT UK fears the increased use of Tasers and pepper sprays by the police;  ACAT UK criticises the lack of guidelines governing the use of Tasers and calls for their suspension pending a full independent inquiry governing their use. It has particular concerns that its use against vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children and people with mental illness is dangerous. It has concerns that it can be used against unarmed individuals and protest groups when excessive force is not needed.  It is now reported that baton rounds of plastic bullets have been made available to police chiefs in an attempt to prevent disorder in London during peaceful protests. These would be   5 carried by a small number of trained officers and according to information would only be used in extreme situations.   4. Children held in immigration removal centers   Large numbers of children, many of them unaccompanied, are still detained at ports in the children. Between May and August 2011 almost 700 children were held  a third of them unaccompanied. There are concerns that children are getting insufficient access to legal advice, health care and education and can experience extreme distress.  A new centre specifically for detained families was opened in August 2011 called Pease Pottage, where failed asylum seekers and their children are housed for a week before being forcibly removed. It replaces the family unit at the controversial Yarls Wood removal centre.  It is run by G4S, the private security firm that also has contracts to forcibly remove failed asylum seekers  it does not have a good reputation. Barnardos, a large, highly respected some other charities.  G4S also manages Tinsley House near Gatwick Airport, which has been refurbished. This guardian is being deported and is too disruptive to be held in Pease Pottage.  ACAT UK  ACAT UK is concerned that although the Government promised to end the detention of children, this has not happened. The much trumpeted Pease Pottage, with its locked environment, is still not the answer to the detention of children. Although some measures have been taken to improve the situation of detained children awaiting deportation, there is much more that needs to be done.   ACAT UK has special concern for those who are unaccompanied and consider that the providing better  should also be challenged to keep to their election Manifestos.  5. Deportation of failed asylum seekers   G4S security guards were hired by the government to deport failed asylum seekers. Jimmy Mabenga, an Angolan, died in transit in October 2010, while being forcibly restrained on a seekers who became disruptive on flights by pushing their heads between their legs. This can reports of force being used on those being removed, including dangerous techniques with resulting injuries, some requiring hospital care. Injuries included punctured lung, dislocated knee, neck injuries and broken fingers. The firm lost its Home Office contract following the death of Jimmy Mabenga.  Whistleblowers from G4S said they warned the company on numerous occasions that potentially lethal force was being used against deportees. They said that the staff were not properly trained, criticised for showing compassion to the failed asylum seekers, particularly   6 children and ostracised if they voiced concerns. Some guards went years without being given Home Office accreditation. The company denied that staff had ever raised concerns.    ACAT UK has concerns over the manner in which deportations are carried out and that force is still being used. It considers that action must be taken by the appropriate Government department to ensure that all security guards are fully trained in acceptable restraining methods and that they treat their charges with humanity, care and respect.   ACAT UK also calls for a monitoring system to be put in place to ensure that no further serious human rights abuses occur on flights involving failed asylum seekers. Special consideration should be given to deciding whether to deport those with mental health problems and those with serious medical complaints.  6. Deportation of failed asylum seekers to countries where they are at risk of arrest, torture or execution  Failed asylum seekers are still being sent back to countries, where they are likely to be arrested, tortured, or even executed such as countries where the death penalty is applied for homosexuality.     ACAT UK has particular concern regarding the welfare of Tamil failed asylum seekers being returned to Sri Lanka, where there have been reports of the torture of returnees. Although a number of deportation orders have been cancelled, the Government insists that there have been no reports of the ill-treatment of returnees.  ACAT UK recommends that the Government takes advice and action to ensure that under no circumstances are failed asylum seekers returned to countries where they will be subjected to human rights abuses.   7. The terms of the inquiry into possible cases of torture and rendition  As a result of the growing pressure, the Government announced in 2010 the setting up of an inquiry with Sir Peter Gibson as chairman, into allegations of the use of torture and extraordinary rendition. The Prime Minister stated that the Coalition was determined to get to ich respected human rights and the rule of law was at risk of being tarnished.   Its detailed terms of reference have now been published, together with protocols relating to it. The hearings are to be held in secret and the Cabinet Secretary will decide what information should be made public.  Individuals who have been subjected to torture or rendition will be unable to question M15 or M16 officers.  No evidence will be sought from foreign intelligence sources, such as the CIA, ISI Pakistan about British involvement in the torture and abuse of detainees. There are also doubts about how far the inquiry will attempt to uncover evidence about operations by British troops which resulted in the secret rendition of detainees to prisons where they were likely to be tortured and ill-treated. The terms of the inquiry are so restrictive that it is likely to fail to comply with international and UK laws governing investigations into torture.      7  ACAT UK has concern that the chair of the inquiry is a retired judge with no experience in the field of human rights issues.  ACAT considers that the inquiry as present constituted will not uncover the full truth regarding the use of torture and rendition.  It calls for the terms of reference to be widened, for no hearing to be held in secret, for witnesses to be called and for individuals subjected to rendition and torture to be allowed to question M15 and M16 officers.    8. The ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance  The Government appears to support the Convention in theory, and has apparently been looking into what changes to domestic law and what reservations or declarations would be needed in order to ratify it.

INTRODUCTION 1. This submission has been prepared by the Wales Monitoring Group on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child  a Wales wide coalition of non-governmental organisations and academic institutions. Established in 2002 the Monitoring Group is chaired by Save the Children Wales and produces the Wales NGO report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child. 2. The issues raised in our submission draw on our concerns regarding children's human rights in the UK and Wales and are based on our previous reports to the CRC Committee in 2007 s Concluding Observations to the UK State party in 2008 and on the Save the e progress on implementing the general measures of the CRC across 5 European countries including the UK and the devolved governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. We work with Save the Children UK and with the Rights of the Child UK Coalition to realise the human rights of children through the full incorporation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).  2. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN'S HUMAN RIGHTS No progress on incorporation of human rights treaties into UK law 3. None of the UN human rights treaties ratified by the UK has, to date, been incorporated into UK law. Treaties only become part of domestic law if an enabling act of parliament has been passed. Instead the UK Government applies a piecemeal approach to implementation and as a result, a number of rights from the conventions to which the UK is a State Party have not been given a legal effect in UK. For example The UN Committee against Torture expressed its concern in 2004 at ""... remaining inconsistencies between the requirements of the Convention Human Rights Act, have left continuing gaps; ..."".  4. This concern is shared by all the UN human rights treaties-based bodies, including the CRC Committee, who have repeatedly called on the UK Government to incorporate the conventions into domestic legislation. The Human Rights Council made the following recommendation to the UK in 2008 relating to the realisation of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: ""The Committee notes that the Covenant is not directly applicable in the State party. In this regard, it recalls that several Covenant rights are not included among the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights which has been incorporated into the domestic legal order through the Human Rights Act 1998. The Committee also notes that the State party is the only Member State of the European Union not to be a party to the Optional Protocol to the Covenant. (art.2)The State party should ensure that all rights protected under the Covenant are given effect in domestic law.""   Recommendation  1. The United Kingdom government should adopt as a matter of urgency appropriate legislative measures to give legal effect to human rights conventions in its domestic law.    Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group: Submission to the UK Universal Periodic Review 21/11/11   3  A UK Bill of Rights and the Human Rights Act 5. The UK Government has established an independent commission to explore the development of a UK Bill of Rights  the commission is currently consulting with the public about the need for a Bill of Rights and will report on its overall findings at the end of 2012.  We are concerned that the  terms of reference have omitted reference to the Human Rights Act, referring only to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Any new Bill of Rights in the UK must build on and strengthen the current provision for human rights afforded by the HRA and not seek to dilute or undermine the legal protection, and opportunities for redress that it currently provides for people of all ages living in the UK.   6. We believe that a UK rights as set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child at a constitutional level in the UK  At the same time, it can give legal effect in UK law to the CRC by incorporating it into domestic legislation.   7. A Bill of Rights is a powerful tool for the enforcement of the human rights of children. It has the potential to set the tone, direction and priorities of government policy, drive statutory reform and deliver budgets predicated on the obligation to promote and protect human rights.   8. In 2008 the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that the UK Government use the British Bill of Rights process .   9. We believe a legally binding Bill of Rights is needed that includes enforceable social, economic and cultural rights. The Committee on the Rights of the Child make it clear in their General Comment 5 that economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights .  There is an urgent need for these rights to be included if the Bill of Rights is truly to build on the HRA and the ECHR, both are dominated by civil and political rights whereas the CRC is a comprehensive and holistic human rights instrument for children setting out the economic, social, and cultural rights which full potential.    Recommendations  2. A UK Bill of Rights must build on and strengthen the existing Human Rights Act  3. A UK Bill of Rights should contain the principles and provisions of the CRC, including also ensuring childre mainstreamed throughout the document.    General Measures of Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 10. The CRC general measures of implementation (Article 4, 42 and 44.6) outline the requirements of the UK government and the steps that must be taken to ensure the full  Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group: Submission to the UK Universal Periodic Review 21/11/11   4 implementation of the CRC and realisation of the rights in the CRC for all children in the UK. The Committee on the Rights of the Child have made it clear in their General Comment 5 that it expects governments to take all appropriate measures so that the CRC is given legal effect within their domestic legal systems and has repeatedly made recommendations to the UK government to do more to ensure the general measures are put in place.  11. The process of devolution in the UK has led to the development of different structures and mechanisms for implementing children's rights across the UK. Save the Children's 2011 research report assesses how the general measures of the CRC have been implemented differently across the UK and the devolved nations and notes that because of this that children across the UK do not enjoy equal protection of their rights. Incorporation of the CRC into UK law 12. In common with other human rights treaties, as noted above, the CRC has not been incorporated into UK domestic legislation more than twenty years after the UK government originally ratified the treaty. for rights to have meaning, effective remedies must be available to redress violationsof accessible redress available to them. 13. with those witnesses who emphasised the benefits of incorporation, accompanied  14. The Rights of the Child UK Coalition, made up of 24 organisations from across the UK, is also calling for progress on this issue along with t four  15. There is much evidence that children in the UK are not able to fully realise their rights;  best interests are not routinely taken into account across policy and legislation;  views and voices are not routinely respected and listened to in legislative and administrative procedures; equal protection from physical punishment is not guaranteed.  The UK now has high levels of child poverty and widening inequalities in health and education. Discrimination experienced by disabled children, by Gypsy, Traveller and Roma children and a growing tendency to exclude children from services and demonise and portray children and young people in a judgemental and negative manner have all been highlighted by NGOs in Wales and in the UK in their monitoring and reports to the CRC Committee who have in turn echoed these concerns in their 2002 and 2008 recommendations to the UK government. 16. The lack of incorporation not only leaves gaps for children across the UK but also leads to a lack of accountability of the government for its obligations to children under the CRC.  For example in December 2010 the UK government, in a written statement, undertook to give  to the Convention whenever making new law and policy. The Ministerial Code refers to the ""overarching duty on Ministers to comply with the law including international law"". This was a welcome development, however, policy analysis carried out by the Children's Rights Alliance for England of UK government processes and actions since that date do not show that this undertaking has been adhered to. Developments at a devolved level  17. More positive developments however have occurred at a devolved level. In Wales the Rights of Children and Young Persons Measure was passed in March 2011 placing a duty on the Welsh Ministers to have due regard to the CRC in exercising any of its functions. A children's scheme, developed through consultation with civil society, must set out the arrangements for carrying out this duty and the Welsh Government must report on a 5 yearly basis as to how it has complied with the due regard duty.   Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group: Submission to the UK Universal Periodic Review 21/11/11   5 18. Whilst this is a welcome step on the road to incorporation, it does not amount to full incorporation and opportunities for redress to Welsh children are limited, however it should raise awareness of children's rights across government and the wider public, begin the culture of embedding a  rights perspective into governmental decision making in Wales and strengthen accountability.  19. The Wales Measure is being implemented against a background of economic recession and spending cuts which are reducing the capacity of government and local authority officials in Wales as elsewhere in the UK. It is now critical that that the Welsh government can take forward their obligations to realising children's rights in Wales by allocating sufficient financial and human resources to effectively implement the Measure 20. This land mark piece of legislation, unique in the UK, has encouraged other devolved governments to look at taking similar steps; the Scottish parliament has also issued proposals for a Children's Rights Bill based on that of the Wales Measure.  Recommendations 4. The UK Government should seek to incorporate the CRC into UK law at the earliest opportunity 5. The Welsh Government should ensure that it puts in place the necessary tools, resources and mechanisms to ensure that the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure is effectively implemented   Independent human rights institutions - Children's Commissioners 21. independent national human rights institutions are an important mechanism to promote and ensure the implementation of the Convention. establishment of such bodies to fall within the commitment made by state parties upon ratification 22. The CRCs Committee General Comment 2 provides guidance on the minimum standards required for independent monitoring bodies on children's rights as does the European Network of Ombudsmen for children (ENOC). The UN General in 1993 which provide clear guidance to governments on the competence, responsibilities and independence of national human rights institutions. 23. The UK now has a Children's Commissioner established in each of the 4 nations; Wales was the first to appoint a Commissioner in 2001 who also has the broadest remit of the four UK Commissioners.  Paris Principles and the CRC Committee specifically called on ensure that all four established commissioners are independent in compliance with the Paris Principles and mandated, inter alia, to receive and investigate complaints from or on behalf of children concerning violations of their rights 24. In addition the Children Act 2004 conferred on the English Children's Commissioner a UK- wide remit in relation to non-devolved issues, despite them having a weaker statutory remit than for example the Wales Commissioner. This leads to inequalities and confusion to children in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland as they would need to seek recourse to the English Commissioner if an issue of their rights is concerned with a non-devolved issue such as juvenile justice, immigration, tax or social security.   Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group: Submission to the UK Universal Periodic Review 21/11/11   6 25. The UK government has recently published welcome proposals from the Dunford independent review to amend the remit of the English Commissioner to be more rights based and has made recommendations that all the UK Commissioners should have the freedom to promote and protect the rights all children who live in their countries regardless of the nature of the complaint.  26. The First Minister for Wales announced in July 2011 that his new programme for government includes proposals to bring in a Children and Young Persons (Wales) Bill which will build on the Rights of Children and Young Persons Measure 2011 and expand the role of the er for Wales. This would be an ideal opportunity to develop the remit of the Wales Commissioner to be Paris Principle compliant and provide more rigorous mechanisms for redress for children in Wales.  Recommendations 6. The UK government and the devolved governments must ensure that the remit of all the Children's Commissioners across the UK are Paris Principle compliant through bringing in new or amended legislation 7. The Welsh Government should use the opportunity of the forthcoming Children and Young Persons (Wales) Bill to: 8. Ensure the Children's Commissioner for Wales is fully compliant with the UN Paris Principles 9. Transfer the funding of the Wales Children's Commissioner from the Welsh Government to the National Assembly for Wales and empower the Commissioner for Wales to investigate and comment on any matter affecting any child ordinarily living in Wales.   Children's budgeting 27. The CRC Committee make it clear no state can tell whether they are fulfilling children's economic, social and cultural rights to the maximum extent of its available resources, as required by Article 4, unless it can identify the proportion of national and other budgets allocated to the social sector and within that to children, directly and indirectly. Producing a children's budget provides a mechanism for governments to examine resource allocation with a view to ascertaining what they say about how children's rights are being implemented. 28. it is not possible to provide an accurate single UK figures, or an assessment of the GDP spent on children's because of a combination of factors such as devolved administrations, differing policy priorities and a variety of ways in which budgets are allocated.  29. The four UK Childalso concluded that [for children] is not dependent on assessed need, is not transparent, is often of short-term nature and its impact in outcomes for chi 30. The CRC Committee have welcomed increased expenditure on children in recent years but undertake an analysis of all sectoral and total budgets across the state party and in the devolved administrations to show the proportion of spend on children.  Developments in Wales  Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group: Submission to the UK Universal Periodic Review 21/11/11   7 31. In contrast to the lack of progress at a UK level, Wales has developed some positive work in this area; an analysis of budgets in 2006, a subsequent statistical bulletin, and the Welsh improving the transparency of budgeting for children and young people2009 National Action Plan on Children's Rights.   32. However, despite recommendations from a Welsh Assembly Committee inquiry into children's budgeting, progress has not been maintained and recent published budgets have not included a Children's Budget Statement or an analysis of how the spending cuts being implemented are impacting on children and their rights.  Recommendations 10. The UK government and the devolved governments should build on the  experience of the Welsh Government and set out spend on children at both national and local levels with a view to ascertaining how effectively their rights are being realised.  11. The Welsh government must maintain and build on its progress to improve the mechanisms to analyse resource allocation to children by  Budget Statements for all its future budgets.   Raising awareness of children's human rights amongst children, parents and professionals working with children 33. if the adults around children do not understand the implications of the Convention, and above all the equal status of children as subjects of rights, it is most unlikely that the rights set out in the convention will  34. The Committee have raised concerns that there is no systematic awareness-raising of the CRC in the UK and that the level of knowledge amongst adults and children is low. They recommend the reinforcement of adequate and systematic training of all professional groups working for and with children, in particular law enforcement officials, immigration officials, media, teachers, health personnel, social workers and personnel of childcare institutions 34. In Wales, The Welsh Government has taken steps to further strengthen its efforts, to ensure that all of the provisions of the Convention are widely known and understood and raising awareness in one of their priorities in their 2009 National Action Plan  Section 5 of the new Rights of Children and Young Persons Measure now places a direct duty on the Welsh Ministers to promote knowledge and understanding of the CRC amongst children, young people and adults this has been in force since May 2011.  In addition the Welsh Government have developed their own website and a range of resources for children, adults and professionals including supporting the development of training resources aimed at professional groups working with children through time limited grants to NGOs including Save the Children in Wales. Revised curriculum for schools also includes the need to teach pupils about human rights and about the CRC 35. These developments are to be welcomed but we remain concerned regarding the lack of a strategic approach to awareness-raising in Wales. In addition the current spending cuts and internal changes in the Welsh Government have seen a significant reduction of the number of civil servants working on the delivery of the UNCRC in Wales, at a time of increased duties around the CRC as the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure comes into  Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group: Submission to the UK Universal Periodic Review 21/11/11   8 force. There remains a lack of understanding, commitment and capacity amongst some professional groups to implement teaching materials and training on the CRC across Wales. Current resources are insufficient to reach the approximately 230,000 professional workers in key groups across Wales. Without a strategic and sustainable awareness raising programme in Wales the Rights of Children and Young Persons Measure will not be fully effective. 36. If the CRC is to be fully implemented then this needs to be accompanied by systematic and rigorous efforts at raising awareness of the CRC with everyone, with a focus on ensuring that all professionals working for and with children have a clear understanding of the CRC and how it applies to their role.   Recommendation 12. The Welsh Government should increase resources for the delivery of training on the UNCRC to law enforcement officials, immigration officials, media, teachers, health personnel, social workers and personnel of childcare institutions.   2. IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS IN RELATION TO CHILDREN   The right to an adequate standard of living Child Poverty 37. Levels of child poverty in the United Kingdom are unacceptable high and are still rising; this is despite the right to an adequate standard of living set out in Article 27 of the CRC and the welcome UK and devolved governments statutory commitment to eradicate child poverty by 2020. 38. There are 3.5 million children growing up in poverty in the UK (after housing costs) with 1.6 million children living in severe poverty (13% of all children). This increases in Wales to 15%, 200,000 children and 96,000 of these are growing up in severe poverty. As of November 2011 one million young people aged 16 to 24 year olds are unemployed in the UK  the highest levels since 1986. 39. Save the Children say that across the UK 900,000 children were lifted out of poverty between 1999 and 2010 but this fell short of the target to halve child poverty by around 800,000 during that same period. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) have projected that child poverty will begin to rise again after 2013 and will reach 4.2million (after housing costs) by 2020.  In effect, the progress made in reducing child poverty between 1999 and 2010 will have been reversed.  Urgent action is needed to get the 2020 target back on track. 40. The Universal Periodic Review on the UK in 2008 recommended that the UK enhance the programmes aimed at addressing socio economic inequalities, from a human rights perspective in fulfilment of its obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, social and cultural Rights provide further information with regard to efforts to reduce poverty among children in half by 2010 41. In 2008 the CRC Committee welcomed the commitment to end child poverty by 2020 and poverty is a very serious problem affecting  Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group: Submission to the UK Universal Periodic Review 21/11/11   9 all and raised concerns   It recommended that the State party  achieving the target of ending child poverty by 2020, including by establishing measurable indicators for their achievement; Give priority in this legislation and in the follow-up actions to those children and their families in most need of support; and w   42. clear pathway towards reaching the 2020 target. Whilst there is a welcome focus on early years in the UK Strategy, there needs to be a much clearer recognition of the financial pressures currently facing families and the impact this is having on the health, education and well-being of children. In particular educational attainment is clearly linked to child poverty; children from poorer families fall behind at an early age compared to their better off peers and this gap is widening.  43. Reaching the 2020 target requires significant political will and investment: Research from the Joseph Roundtree Foundation in 2009 estimated that an extra annual investment of 4.2 billion will be required to meet the 2020 target. This investment would help low income families at a time of welfare retrenchment, wage stagnations, public service cuts and increasing levels of unemployment. 44. We have particular concerns about the impact on children and families of the Welfare Reform Bill, we believe the changes proposed to the welfare system will disproportionately affect the poorest families; disabled adults and children in particular will be hardest hit. Wales 45. In Wales, taxation, social security and employment legislation remain the responsibility of the UK government. The Welsh Government does though have responsibility for the other policy areas which impact on the experience and the effects of living in poverty; education, housing, health, social services, childcare, job creation and the take up of social security benefits. In recent years it had worked towards developing an understanding of child poverty from a human rights perspective, and committed to a poverty strategy based on the CRC.  46. In 2010 Wales passed the Children and Families Measure which makes statutory provision to take forward the commitment to eradicate child poverty placing a duty on the Welsh Government and other public bodies to produce a child poverty strategy. 47. The National strategy commendably focuses on addressing the inequalities and the widening gaps in education, health and participation of children between those living in poverty and those from better off families.  However there is little evidence of a rights based approach in the current delivery plan and in common with concerns at a UK level there is a lack of accountability and clarity as to how key targets are to be monitored and assessed.  Recommendations 13. The UK Government should set out a clear pathway towards meeting the 2020 target 14. The UK Government should set a target to eradicate severe child poverty by the end of the Parliament   Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group: Submission to the UK Universal Periodic Review 21/11/11   10 15 The UK Government should invest in Child Tax Credits and benefits so that levels of child poverty do not increase  16. The UK Government should reduce in-work poverty and ensure employment is an effective route out of poverty by allocating the resources needed to create clear work incentives for parents so that they keep more of their earnings 17. The Welsh Government should have due regard to Article 4 of the UNCRC and allocate the maximum extent of available resources to tackling child poverty within their devolved powers in Wales 18. The Welsh Government should ensure clear targets and milestones are included in the Wales Child Poverty Strategy and in future strategies and guidance. 19. The Welsh Government should invest in high quality early education and care 20. The Welsh Government should target education funding towards children living in poverty  The right to non- discrimination Gypsy and Traveller children 48. Article 2 of the CRC states that all rights apply to all children without exception; it is the  to protect children from any form of discrimination and to take positive action to promote their rights.  49. In their recommendations in 2008 the CRC Committee raised concerns about the experiences of Gypsy, Traveller and Roma children living in the UK, including that in practice certain groups of children, such as: Roma and Irish Travellersbelonging to minority groups continue to experience discrimination and social stigmatization. They also noted that Gypsy and Traveller children are amongst the groups who are not realising their right to education and that discrimination and accommodation issues mean that their right to an adequate standard of living is denied.  50. The Committee recommend that the UK government should consider Strengthening its awareness-raising and other preventive activities against discrimination and, if necessary, taking affirmative actions for the benefit of vulnerable groups of children, such as Roma and  and a clear further recommendation Reintroduce a statutory duty for local authorities to provide safe and adequate sites for Travellers. 51. In Wales the Welsh Government has published Travelling to a Better Future - a Framework for Action which aims to tackle the inequalities and social exclusion experienced by Gypsy Travellers in Wales. Whilst this is welcome there remains a lack of a coherent delivery plan and the rights under the CRC do not obviously underpin the document. In particular, the CRC concluding observations made in 2008 are not addressed. 52. Save the Children run the Travelling Ahead project which supports the participation of young Gypsies and Travellers in Wales. Their work highlights some key issues: - Discrimination: Most young Gypsies and Travellers highlight discrimination as a key issue in their lives. This can take the form of bullying, media portrayal, a lack of opportunities, collective punishment, or outright racism. - Accommodation: Access to safe and stable accommodation is also a significant issue. There is a huge shortfall of pitches on authorised sites in Wales, meaning that many families are forced to live by the roadside or on unauthorised encampments.   Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group: Submission to the UK Universal Periodic Review 21/11/11   11 - Health: Shocking health statistics have come from various small-scale studies on Gypsy and Traveller health. Infant mortality has been recorded as three times the national average with higher incidences of asthma, bronchitis, anxiety, depression, and later in life, significantly lower life expectancy - Education: Young people from these communities have the lowest school attendance of any ethnic group and the worst educational attainment. They also have high levels of school exclusion. - Identity: Young Gypsies and Travellers grow up in Wales proud of their culture but tied to the stigma that it attracts. Through negative media portrayal, collective treatment by many, hostile public opinion and a lack of services, these young people become isolated and marginalised from the rest of young people in society.  Recommendations 21. The Welsh Government should re-instate the duty on local authorities to provide authorised sites where there is need.  22. The Welsh Government should encourage better ethnic monitoring of Gypsies and Travellers in the healthcare system to ensure that the true picture of health inequalities is revealed and confronted.  23. The Welsh Government should maintain the specific grant for Gypsy and Traveller education and work with schools to host open-days and properly deal with racist bullying.   Equal protection for children under the law  Physical punishment 53. Physical punishment is banned in schools, alternative care and childcare settings throughout the UK, but remains legal in the home and private foster care as long as it can be trivial and transitory. This is a clear international human rights law and in particular under Article 19 of the CRC which guaranteethe Universal Periodic Review of the UK made 3 recommendations urging the UK to reconsider its position and legally ban corporal punishment. 54. In a recent study (Radford et al, 2010, NSPCC) focussing on the prevalence of child maltreatment in the UK, 41.6% of parents or guardians said they had physically punished or ir children in the past year (39.4% of the parents or guardians of under 11s and 45.9% of parents or guardians of 11-17 year olds.)  55. There has been pressure for complete removal of the reasonable punishment defence so as to give children equal protection under the law on assault from the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and the European Committee of Social Rights:   (2009 Committee on ESCR) and The Committee recommends that the State party:  Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group: Submission to the UK Universal Periodic Review 21/11/11   12 a) With urgency adopt  defence and prohibit all corporal punishment in the family and in any other contexts not covered by existing legislation; b) Promote positive, participatory and non-violent forequal right to human dignity and physical integrity, engaging with children and parents and all those who work with and for them, and carry out public education programmes on the negative consequences of corporal Committee) Developments in Wales 56. Working to make physical punishment of children and young people illegal in all situationss children's rights National Action Plan. In June 2009, Welsh Ministers signed up to the Children are Unbeatableampaign statement and We remain committed to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the a global ban on physical punishme however the legal powers to change the law remained with the UK government at that time.  Welsh resources for parents promoting positive parenting methods suchave been produced but its not clear if and how this approach is being monitored for its effectiveness. 57. In 2011 the National Assembly for Wales has recently voted in favour of introducing legislation to remove the defence of reasonable punishment. Following the introduction of enhanced legislative powers for the National Assembly for Wales, the First Minister has now clarified that there is competence to legislate in this area.  58. The Deputy Minister for Children has however indicated that legislation to remove the defence of reasonable punishment will not be introduced in the current legislative session (2011-2016). It is a concern that whilst the motion to remove the defence of reasonable punishment was passed by the National Assembly for Wales in plenary session, the Welsh Ministers present, including the First Minister and the Deputy Minister respoissues, all abstained in the vote. If the Welsh Government is to take action to ensure that law and policy in Wales meets with the obligations imposed by the UNCRC this will require the express support of the Welsh Ministers.   Recommendations  24. The UK Government should move quickly to satisfy its human rights obligations by ensuring that children have full protection from abuse under the law 25. The Welsh Government should as a matter of urgency introduce legislation to remove the defence of reasonable punishment in Wales in order to give children equal protection under the law on assault. Alongside legislation the Welsh Government should invest resources to actively promote positive, non-violent discipline of children and monitor their effectiveness      Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group.

37,JS9 - Disability Rights Watch UK,"1       Submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review  UK's examination (13th Session - June 2012)           Joint submission by Disability Rights Watch UK   (Word count: 5,635)        I: Background to this submission  1. In this submission, we have focused on the UK Government's performance on its human rights obligations and commitments as they relate to disabled people - principally under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). This joint submission has been prepared by a loose coalition of organisations as part of the Disability Rights Watch UK project run by UK Disabled People's Council (UKDPC). The project aims to ensure that disabled people, disabled people's organisations (DPOs) and disability organisations, are fully involved in monitoring the UK's performance in implementing the UN CRPD. .  2. The coalition members include  the following organisations which have contributed to preparing this submission: Norfolk Coalition of Disabled People, Alliance for Inclusive Education, Inclusion London, The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, Disability Alliance, Disability Equality North West, Equalities National Council, Action on Hearing Loss, Disability Action Northern Ireland, Mencap, Royal National Institute of Blind People, Radar, Scope, Sense, Learning Disability Coalition, Capability Scotland.   2   II. Summary:  3. Whilst all issues covered in this submission are of critical importance to the UK being able to meet its obligations under the CRPD, we would ask the Council to give the most urgent consideration to the following key concerns emerging from developments in Government policy and action:    The failure on the part of the Government to take concrete steps towards withdrawing its four reservations and the interpretative declaration to the CRPD   A lack of commitment to incorporate the CRPD into domestic law   A lack of Government leadership on disability issues and particularly the failure to create an adequate mechanism to ensure effective cross-government work on disability   The proposals to weaken or not to implement important provisions of the Equality Act   on disabled people   The proposals to restrict the scope of civil legal aid and the adverse effect of this on disabled   The reduction to Access to Work support which is crucial for disabled people to stay in employment   III. International framework and obligations:   Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 4. The ratification of the UN CRPD on 8 June 2009 and its Optional Protocol on 7 August 2009 has been a progressive act on the part of the UK Government. However, despite its stated commitment to the Convention, the UK also entered four reservations and an interpretative declarationi.    5. When the proposals for reservations were scrutinised prior to the Government's ratification of the Convention, they were the subject of widespread criticism from civil society and parliamentary scrutiny committees, including the Joint Committee on Human Rights, on grounds that they were unnecessary or contrary to the object and purpose of the Conventionii. The Government's review of the immigration reservation is currently underwayiii. We recommend that the Government take account of all the evidence about the incompatibility of this reservation with the principles of the Convention (such as that submitted by the Equality and Human Rights Commissioniv), and move to withdraw it.   6. Despite this, it is regrettable that as it stands, the Government continues to maintain the four reservations and the interpretative declaration to the CRPD. We strongly encourage the Government to reconsider its reservations and interpretative declaration so as to withdraw them immediately.   7. As regards the implementation of article 35, we are concerned about the delay of the Government to submit its Initial Report to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Government has issued and consulted on the draft report about its compliance with the UN CRPDv, however the final report is yet to be published and submitted to the UN Committee. We recommend that the Government submits its report as a matter of urgent priority. In addition, the quality of the draft report is disappointing as this fails to critically assess the extent to which the Government is complying with the CRPD. Worryingly, the report also glosses over the concerns raised by disabled people as to the impact of some of the planned reforms, such as around the effect of welfare reforms and reforms in education, which risk undermining progress made in implementing the CRPD. s  8. As it stands, the provisions in the Convention may be used by the courts if these are relevant to any question arising in any proceedings. However, the failure to fully incorporate its provisions into domestic law limits the opportunities disabled people have to enforce their rights. We are disappointed that the Government has yet to express any intentions in this regard. The Government should take appropriate  3  legal measures to ensure the effective incorporation of its obligations under the CRPD into UK domestic law.  9. CRPD. This role is being carried out by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in England (and the equivalent UK should move to create such a framework, ensuring that civil society, and in particular disabled people and their representative organisations, are involved and participate fully in the monitoring process as required by article 33(3) of the Convention.  Recommendation:   The Government should take steps to remove all of the reservations and interpretative declaration made to the CRPD as a matter of urgent priority.   IV. Achievements and best practice:    Measures to improve disabled people's participation in public and political life  10. The Government has introduced a number of positive measures which are designed to improve the participation of disabled people in public and political life, taking into account the compelling evidence that exists that disabled people continue to be greatly under-represented in elected officevi. In particular, the Government has consulted on establishing an Access to Elected Office Fund which would cover the extra costs disabled candidates incur as a direct result of their impairment when running for elected office. £1 million has been allocated annually between 2011/12 and 2013/14 for this purposevii.   Recommendation:  In taking this commitment forward, the Government should ensure the successful implementation of the fund and consider how best to support disabled people seeking to stand for public office beyond this Parliament.   Building on these measures, the Government should also bring into force section 106 of the Equality Act 2010, which would require political parties to report on the diversity of their election candidatesviii. This would provide an effective way of assessing the impact that the introduction of the Access of Election Office Fund has had in practice.   Measures to better record disability hate crime and improve sentencing  11. The priority given to disability hate crime issue is welcome. The Government has acted on the Coalition Agreement commitment to 'promote better recording of hate crimes against disabled people, which are frequently not centrally recorded'ix and ensure this data is systematically recorded by police forces. Efforts to tackle disability hate crime have thus far been hampered by a lack of data on the extent of disability hate crimex. The police forces have only just begun centrally recording statistics, and the first data is expected to be published in 2012.   12. In addition, the Government has promised to amend the legislation as part of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill to increase the minimum sentences imposed on individuals who commit murders which are motivated by prejudice or hostility to disabled people, to thirty yearsxi. This will be a positive development when implemented, though the ability for the Attorney General to review sentences that are unduly lenient remains stronger for victims of racist and religiously motivated crime than for victims of disability hate crime. This is due to inconsistencies in the legal framework which provides specific offences for racist hate crime that do not exist for other forms of hate crime. Consideration should be given to how to best provide equal protection of law for all forms of hate crime.  13. However, despite some increased efforts to tackle disability hate crime, a major inquiry undertaken by the Equality and Human Rights Commission has found that police and other public authorities do not  4  respond effectively to the issue of disability hate crimexii. The EHRC's report highlighted that 'the failure of public agencies to share intelligence, co-ordinate their responses and treat harassment as a priority meant that opportunities to bring harassment to an end were missed'xiii. These findings were corroborated by the various inquiries of the Independent Police Complaints Commission in response to serious cases where due to this inaction, the violence experienced subsequently escalated resulting in the death of disabled people involved, such as the case of Fiona Pilkington and her daughter where police failed to pick up the on-going abusexiv. The Government is still to advance a cross government hate crime action plan to replace that of the previous administration. This is hampering the efforts to implement essential cross agency responses.  Recommendation:   The UK Government should progress as soon as possible the publication of its hate crime action plan to ensure the police, local authorities, housing authorities and other public authorities work more effectively together to tackle disability hate crime.   all disability hate crime, with movement towards the creation of specific offences for disability hate crime.  V. Challenges and constraints:   Equality Act and weakening of protection against discrimination  14. The period since the first UPR review (2008-2012) has seen disabled people being afforded a greater level of protection against discrimination with the passing of the Equality Act 2010.  However, notwithstanding the advances in protection from discrimination introduced through the Equality Act 2010, there has since been significant weakening of important provisions in the Act relating to how public bodies in England are required to achieve equality for disabled peoplexv.   15. Under the Disability Discrimination Act of 1995 and 2005 (DDA), which preceded the Equality Act, there was a duty which required all public authorities to promote disability equality and eliminate disability discrimination. This general duty was underpinned by a set of specific requirements (specific duties) such as the duty on all public authorities to conduct a disability impact assessment of all new and existing policies and practices. These duties resulted in an improved understanding among public bodies of the impact of their policies on disabled peoplexvi.   16. The Equality Act introduced a new Single Public Sector Equality Duty encompassing all of the protected characteristics in the Act, including disability. The new duty has, however, been undermined by the Government's failure in England to set a robust set of specific duties such as those that existed under the previous DDA. In particular, the new regulations that came into force lack an explicit requirement for public bodies to engage with disabled people in delivering services and carrying out other functions. This is a retrograde step considering the emphasis on involvement which was a core component of the duty under the DDA.   17. The potential for this to lead to a reduced commitment among public bodies to tackling inequalities is a great cause for concern. The changes set out in the regulations would allow public bodies to only commit to a minimum of one objective relating to equality - for instance, a public body could set an objective relating to race equality, but no objectives to other areas of equality, such as disability. There is a risk that a large number of public bodies will fail to identify and take measures to remove structural discrimination, leaving the roots of discrimination faced by disabled people unchallenged.   18. Furthermore, despite strong cross-party support when passed in Parliament, the Equality Act was subject to a UK Government web-based public consultation (the Red Tape Challenge) on whether any of the provisions contained in the Act should be scrapped, which raises further doubts over the commitment to this legislation on the part of the Government. We are deeply concerned about the  5  repeated portrayal of this legislation, by the Government in recent months, as being overly burdensome. Whilst we welcome the Home Secretary Theresa May's subsequent reassurance that the Government does not intend to repeal the Actxvii, there remains a significant degree of uncertainty of changes which may be made to the Act as a result of this exercise.   Recommendation:   The Government should commit to a programme of full implementation of the Equality Act 2010, including the sections in the Act which have not yet been brought into force, and ensure that there is no regression from the current levels of protection.   Potential weakening of human rights protection 19. Building on one of its pledges, the Coalition Government has established in 2011 an independent Commission to investigate the case for developing a UK Bill of Rightsxviii. Since the Commission was formed, many organisations in the human rights community have voiced grave concerns that this represents as an attempt to weaken existing legal protections and seeks to undermine the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA). The HRA, which is the main way in which the European Convention on Human Rights is given effect in the UK, also acts to protect many of the rights contained in the UN CRPD. Any weakening of the HRA would therefore inevitably result in a failure on the part of the UK to meet its obligations under the Convention.   20. Human rights protection afforded by the HRA protection has had a positive impact on disabled people's lives, particularly by establishing a culture of respect for human rights within public services. The Government's review of the implementation of the HRA carried out by the former Department for Constitutional Affairs concluded that 'the Human Rights Act leads to better policy outcomes, by ensuring that the needs of all members of the UK's increasingly diverse population are appropriately considered. It promotes greater personalisation and therefore better public services'xix.   21. Notwithstanding this, there remains much potential to improve the scope of protection that disabled people enjoy at the domestic level. The HRA does not address the particular circumstances of disabled people in the way that the CRPD does. If existing rights are preserved, the development of a Bill of Rights could present an opportunity to strengthen disabled people's rights by giving a greater effect to the provisions in the UN CRPD at the domestic level. We would advocate for using the language of CRPD in any Bill of Rights and enshrining this in UK law.   Recommendation:  The Government should ensure that the legal protection offered to disabled people by the Human Rights Act 1998 is not threatened and, if a Bill of Rights is introduced, that the HRA is only enhanced to further the protection of rights that disabled people enjoy in line with the CRPD.   Any UK Bill of Rights should respect the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland through the creation of a distinct Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement.    Weakening of disability within Government infrastructure 22. A new disability strategy is expected by spring 2011 (following public consultation). The new director of the Office for Disability Issues Jeremy Moore has stated in a recent speech that the Government's aim is 'to publish an initial discussion document outlining the Government's strategic vision in December', with a view for the final strategy to be published in spring 'after a period of discussion with disabled people, their organisations and others'xx. This is welcome, and we hope that the new strategy to be grounded in the UK's obligations under the CRPD. Nevertheless, the new strategy has also given rise to concerns, particularly as it is still unclear as to whether it will set the direction for Government action towards progressing disability equality in line with the Convention in the long term.    6  23. Furthermore, we are concerned about the weakening of the role and remit of the Office of Disability Issues and of the Minister for Disabled People, with whom lies the responsibility for the promotion across Government of disabled people's rights lies. Despite originally being designated as the champion for disabled people across government, both the ODI and the Minister have increasingly failed to fulfil this role and have focused more narrowly on welfare and work (which in the UK come under the remit of the Department and Work and Pensions) agenda.   24. These developments have to be stood next to the Government's proposals to reform the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which will result in a significant reduction in the resources of the Commission, as well as narrowing of its role and remitxxi. Of particular concern is stripping the powers that the Commission currently has and leaving it with only legalistic levers to deliver equality. This would not be enough to tackle some of the inequalities that persist, nor would it enable the Commission to deliver substantive equality for disabled people. It is vital that the EHRC be adequately equipped to continue to address the more challenging inequalities that affect disabled people.   Recommendation:   The Government's forthcoming strategy should include specific reference to the rights and provisions of the CRPD, and explain how these underpin its goals, and how future policy and activities will build towards the full protection described by the Convention.   The Government should review the role and remit of the ODI and the Minister for Disabled People, with a view to putting it on a more strategic footing, and should not undermine the EHRC's mandate to promote equality and human rights.   The Government should ensure that the ODI is adequately resourced to be in a position to enable cross-cutting work across departments, and to ensure disability is fully mainstreamed within Government.   Disproportionate impact of public spending cuts on disabled people  25. There are grave concerns that the impact of welfare reform package announced by the Government in 2010 has been felt disproportionately by disabled peoplexxii. In particular, the Government plans to reduce expenditure by 20 per cent on the Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which is an allowance awarded to disabled people as recognition of the additional costs of living with a disabilityxxiii, would be particularly detrimental to disabled people. This represents a cut of £2.17 billion which will affect more than 835,000 disabled peoplexxiv who would lose their entitlement to DLA. This support is crucial for disabled people, enabling a more independent life and participation in the community, and for some it helps achieve an adequate standard of living. The withdrawal of this benefit is likely to lead to substantial regression, rather than the progressive realisation of their human rights.   26. The Government is also consulting on a new assessment for establishing eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which will replace DLA in 2013. The reduction in budget is likely to be achieved through tighter eligibility criteria that will see those disabled people judged not to have the most serious needs, removed from DLA/PIP. This will have huge implications for the well-being, independence and enjoyment of human rights for around 652,000 disabled people currently receiving low rate care DLA payments for whom the new PIP will not provide an equivalent level of supportxxv.   27. It is generally accepted that plans to reduce the deficit will adversely impact on the Government's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Convention and on the realisation of disabled people's rights. About 400,000 disabled people will also lose Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) once this out of work support becomes time limited to one year for people who have previously paid National Insurance contributionsxxvi. This policy will place an arbitrary time limit on contributory ESA, which is not based on any evidence of how long it takes an ESA claimant to find work or improve their healthxxvii.   28. The impact of the proposed welfare measures is likely to be cumulative and far reaching. The Government has also announced that the Independent Living Fund  which provides financial assistance  7  to disabled people and helps councils support disabled people with the highest  needs across the UK  will be permanently closed to new applicants, with no announcement as to what funding might replace itxxviii. At the same time, tightening of eligibility for social care and support by local Government mean that more disabled people will find themselves without adequate support to live independently and participate in their local communities. Because of a 26 per cent reduction in central Government funding, 81 per cent of local councils have been forced to restrict support to those disabled people with only the highest (substantial and critical) needsxxix.  29. This is putting pressure on an already stretched care and support system in the UK which is approaching crisis pointxxx. Despite two independent commissions on the reform of fundingxxxi and modernising care and supportxxxii, the Government is continuing to consultxxxiii on plans rather than seeking a viable cross-party model that guarantees protection and assistance as required under the CRPD. Existing legislation restricts disabled people freedom of movementxxxiv and does not adequately provide for assessed level of needxxxv.  30. Cuts to programmes that support independent living at the national and local level, and the failure to take progressive action on the continuing care crisis, is putting at risk the infrastructure that enables disabled people to participate in, and contribute to society. This trend is further exacerbated by the funding for disabled people's organisations (DPOs) being drastically reduced, which threatens the very existence of many of themxxxvi.   Recommendation:   The Government must use the scrutiny powers available to initiate an independent review of the value for money and compliance of reforms with human rights mechanisms by the Public Accounts Committee, National Audit Office and Joint Committee on Human Rights and use their recommendations for revisiting planned reforms to welfare and support.  The Government must commit to addressing the care crisis and ensuring modernised system covers the true cost of need.  Reduction in support for disabled children and their families 31. The Government has set out its plans for introducing the new Universal Credit, the aim of which is to merge all benefits and tax credits into a single scheme. The Government estimates that this will take 350,000 children out of povertyxxxvii. Questions have, however, been raised as to whether these ambitions can be realised in practice. Analysis has revealed that disabled children and their families could lose out significantly in terms of the support they receive compared to the current system. Under the new Universal Credit which will see the disability element of child tax credit replaced with a 'disability addition' for the child within household benefits entitlements, around 100,000 families could see their support cut in half from a maximum of £52 per week, down to £25.95xxxviii.   32. A predicted estimate of the losses in income that families with disabled children would see as a result of this change has been calculated to amount up to £1366 per yearxxxix. Removing this support risks undermining the Government's own commitment to reduce child poverty, through its first ever child poverty strategy, published in April 2011. At present, the Government only has a partial picture, at best, of the levels of poverty among disabled children, as statistics take no account of the additional costs faced by families with disabled childrenxl.   33. In addition, in May 2010, the coalition Government's programme promised to remove the bias away from inclusion in the education system. The subsequent Special Educational Needs (SEN) Green Paper proposes to reform the support children with SEN receivexli, but the assumption underpinning the Government's policy is fundamentally incompatible with the right to inclusive education set out in the Convention and in fact does not reflect the reality for parents who struggle to get the right level of support for their child in mainstream education.   8   Recommendation:   The Government must ensure disabled children and their families do not lose out in the shift to the new benefits system under the Universal Credit, and that disabled children's ability to participate and be included into society is not undermined as a consequence of the Government's reforms of the SEN system.   Impact of proposals to restrict legal aid in terms of access to justice 34. The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Billxlii, currently passing through Parliament, sets out measures which would remove civil legal aid from a number of areas of law, including housing, education, welfare benefits and employment. The House of Commons Justice Select Committee has raised concerns that the changes could adversely impact particular groups, as the Government conceded that it was not certain of the impact, including on disabled people, due to information gapsxliii.    35. The equality impact assessments that examine the proposals to restrict the categories of cases for which legal aid will be provided in the future highlighted that disabled people rely more on legal aid that other groups and that there is a very real risk that they will be disproportionately impacted by the proposed changesxliv. This difference is greater in certain areas of law to be taken out of scope: for example, disabled people make up 58 per cent of those who receive legal aid for welfare benefits cases and who would be denied specialist legal advice if these proposals are implemented (with at least 78,000 disabled people losing access to legal aid as a result)xlv. This will effectively leave many disabled people unable to enforce their rights, undermining the UK Government's obligations under the CRPD.   Recommendation:  The Government should commit to retaining the current level of legal aid funding for social welfare law, and ensure that all disabled people have access to good quality publicly funded legal advice when they need it and in cases where their rights are affected.   Reductions in employment support and lack of access to employment opportunities  36. Cuts to work-related benefits, such as Employment Support Allowance, are happening as in-work support is being reduced. An independent review into supporting disabled people getting and staying in work focused strongly on the need to expand and improve Access to Workxlvi, which is a core scheme that provides funds for adaptations and equipment to support disabled people in the workplace. However, there is growing evidence about disabled people having had their level of support reduced or changes being made to the kinds of support that can be funded. Government statistics reveal that fewer disabled people are getting crucial support through this schemexlvii: just 13,280 of new customers were given funding in 2010-11, compared to 16,500 in 2009-10xlviii. A reduction in Access to Work support would substantially restrict the employment opportunities disabled people have, as the cost for adaptations would have to be met by employers or disabled people themselves.   37. Furthermore, there is a range of specialist disability employment provision in place. The Government has replaced all welfare-to-work schemes into a single 'Work Programme' which was introduced in 2011. It intends to offer a personalised package of support to disabled people out of work. There has been concern, however, that by continuing to use models similar to previous employment initiatives, the Work Programme will have similarly low success ratesxlix. In the black box and payment by result approaches that the Government is pursuing in its funding of the Work Programme, the Government has failed to avoid the 'creaming' of those disabled people needing more support who have more complex barriers and are a greater distance from the workplace (with providers of the Work Programme focusing instead on the most job-ready clients).   38. ds of each individual disabled person and provides specialised support to find employment and to keep employment once a job has been found and started. Underfunding of this specialist support means that in reality very few disabled  9  people will be able to get a place on the scheme, with only 13,000 places for Work Choice available each yearl.    39. When exploring disability employment support, the emphasis has been placed primarily on incentivising benefit recipients to work. This, however, overlooks the need to incentivise employers to make reasonable adjustment for disabled applicants. To improve the current low rates of employment for disabled people, there needs to be a greater recognition of the disadvantage disabled people face in the labour market, due to the lack of jobs and persisting negative attitudes. This is particularly relevant as the Government considers reforming sheltered employment and residential training colleges, and moving disabled people into mainstream work opportunities. While we generally welcome the direction that an independent review has recently recommendedli, the Government must also consider the transitional protection for thousands of disabled people currently located in sheltered employment and those in residential training colleges.   Recommendation:    The Government should commit to a review of the Work Programme after a year to monitor how effective the models are, and see how providers are meeting the needs of disabled people with more complex needs, who may move closer to towards the labour market, but would require support over a longer period.   The Government should implement the recommendations to expand and guarantee increased investment into Access to Work set out by the independent review.   The Government should address the need for transitional protection for disabled people in Remploy factories and those in residential training colleges.   Negative portrayal of disabled people  40. Issues around disabled people receiving welfare benefits are frequently presented in a negative light. A study on the coverage of disability issues in the media demonstrates that there has been an increase in articles focused on disability benefit and fraud and that negative reporting of disabled people as 'undeserving' has become commonplace within medialii. It also highlighted the repetitive use of derogatory or negative terms such as 'scrounger', 'cheat' and 'skiver' in association with disabled peopleliii. It concluded that 'this strength of fraud as a tabloid theme conflicts with the reality of levels of incapacity benefit fraud' and detracts from 'problems in lack of labour market demand, economic policies or discrimination'liv. Worryingly, research has also shown that this may be contributing to stigmatisation, victimisation and exclusion of disabled peoplelv. There are concerns that negative media coverage of disability issues has been exacerbated by misrepresentation of statistics on disability related benefits in Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) press releaseslvi.   Recommendation:   Within the announced review into UK press standardslvii, the Government should address the need for greater accountability for how issues affecting disabled people, and particularly those claiming state benefits, are covered in the media.   Private health and social care provision  41. Victimisation, neglect and ill-treatment of disabled people in privately-run residential care establishments are a real cause for concern. A range of Convention breaches have been documented in the recent case at Winterbourne View care home, Bristol. A BBC programme in May 2011 exposed the systematic abuse of people with learning disabilities and autism, including instances where residents were routinely kicked, taunted, dragged into showers while fully clothed, pinned down and slappedlviii. There have been increasing concerns about private care being profit-driven and their capability to uphold human rights, whilst seeking to exploit economies of scale and undertaking risks that put those rights at peril.   42. The recent care home crisis is an example of growing trend of privatisation of Government services, which will only be accelerated under the Government plans to allow private companies to bid for most  10  public services. Within the context of the health reforms, the Government is proposing to create new structures such as GP consortia to take charge of commissioning almost all NHS services, which could be taken over by private companies. Furthermore, this is occurring against a wider context increasingly focused on the personalisation of services, reflecting the expectations that disabled people should be able to exercise choice and control over any support they may needlix. This includes a range of options, including having a direct payment or a personal budget to arrange support, and represents a positive step towards realising disabled people's rights in the CRPD, but does raise questions as to whether a greater connection with human rights is needed within a system of self-directed support. Taken together, these developments pose the risk of further blurring the human rights obligations of organisations involved in the provision, commissioning and regulation of health and social care.   Recommendation:  With both health and social care to be significantly reformed, the Government must undertake a review into whether current human rights protection is sufficient to protect disabled people's rights, and how any new structures created under planned reforms will need to be able to evidence their compliance with human rights of disabled people.   Failure to protect right to life 43. In recent months, there has been an on-going public debate about assisted suicidelx, with many arguing about the urgency of the need to reform the law to legalise assisted suicide. The context for this debate has been set by an increase in the number of cases where there may have been sufficient evidence to charge a person with aiding a suicide, but where the Crown Prosecution Service has made a decision not to pursue a prosecution. Guidance on when prosecutions should be brought has been published by the Crown Prosecution Service in 2009lxi. There have been no prosecutions resulting from the last 44 cases since the guidelines came into forcelxii. This creates a real danger of inadvertently weakening legal protection of disabled people's right to life, which would run counter to the obligations under the CRPD. Should reform of the law allow assisted suicide to be introduced, there will be a great risk of disabled people being subject to coercion to end their own lives, however tight the safeguards.   Recommendation:   The Government must avoid weakening the legal protection disabled people currently enjoy of their right to life, by decriminalising the offence of aiding a person to commit suicide.   Statistics and Data 44. The availability of appropriate disaggregated accessible information and statistics under Article 31 and 21 UNCRPD to the State, the independent monitoring body, civil society and crucially disabled people and their representatives is central to evidence-based policy making and to an effective monitoring process under Article 33 UNCRPD.    Recommendation  The Government should collect data and statistics to facilitate CRPD implementation, in line with its obligations under CRPD.              11  References                                                             i UN Enable, CRPD reservations and declarations, http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=475   ii http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200809/jtselect/jtrights/78/78.pdf iii Border Agency(2011), UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Review of immigration reservation, http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/consultations/29-un-convention-disabilities/review-imm-reservation.pdf?view=Binary  iv Equality and Human Rights Commission (2011), Response to the Home Office consultation: Review of the immigration reservation, http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/consultations/ho_crpd_consultation_response.doc http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/legal-and-policy/consultation-responses/response-to-home-office-consultation-review-of-immigration-reservation/ v Office for Disability Issues (2011), Draft report on the UN Convention on the Rights for Disabled People,  http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/disabled-people-and-legislation/un-convention-on-the-rights-of-disabled-people/have-your-say.php vi House of Commons (2010), Speaker's Conference on Parliamentary Representation Final Report, http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/spconf/239/239i.pdf  vii Government Equalities Office (2010), Access to Elected Office for Disabled People - A consultation, http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/docs/abo/aeo.pdf  viii This provision in Equality Act following from recommendation of the Speaker's Conference on Parliamentary representation, http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/spconf/239/239i.pdf  ix Ministry of Justice (2011), MOJ Equalities Annual Review 2010-2011, http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/corporate-reports/MoJ/equalities-annual-review-2010-2011.pdf x Only data available is Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) figures which shows an increase by one fifth of incidence of disability hate crime in 2010, though a variety of reports have indicated that this is in all likelihood a great underestimation of the extent of disability hate crime, http://www.acpo.presscentre.com/Press-Releases/ACPO-publishes-hate-crime-data-for-2010-111.aspx xi Parliamentary debate at Report stage of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111101/debtext/111101-0002.htm#11110173000002 xii Equality and Human Rights Commission (2011), Hidden in plain sight, http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/disabilityfi/ehrc_hidden_in_plain_sight_3.pdf xiii Ibid xiv Independent Police Complaints Commission (2011),  IPCC report into the contact between Fiona Pilkington and Leicestershire Constabulary 2004-2007, http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/Pages/pr_240511_pilkington.aspx xv Equality Act (Specific Duties) Regulations 2011, http://services.parliament.uk/hansard/Lords/ByDate/20110906/mainchamberdebates/part006.html  xvi Office for Disability Issues (2008), An In-Depth Examination of the Implementation of the Disability Equality Duty in  England, http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/docs/res/ded/ded-implementation-report-08.pdf xvii Cabinet Office (2011), Red Tape Challenge - Equalities, http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/equalities-act/ xviii Commission on a Bill of Rights (2011), Do we need a Bill of Rights Discussion Paper, http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/about/cbr/cbr-discussion-paper.pdf xix Former Department for Constitutional Affairs (2006), Review of the implementation of the Human Rights Act, http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/docs/full_review.pdf .   xxJeremy Moore Speech to Inside Government Disability Forum (27 October 2011), http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/about-the-odi/speech.php.  xxi Government Equalities Office (2011), Building a fairer Britain: Reform of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, http://www.parliament.uk/deposits/depositedpapers/2011/DEP2011-0505.pdf xxii Demos (2010), Destination Unknown: Spring 2011, http://www.demos.co.uk/files/Destination_unknown_Spring_2011_-_web.pdf?1305026600 xxiii HM Treasury (2011), Budget 2010 Policy Costings, http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/junebudget_costings.htm xxiv Disability Alliance (2011), End of a lifeline?

BACKGROUND AND FRAMEWORK  1. This submission to the United Nations Universal Periodic Review is drawn from feedback and evidence provided by NGO members of Together. Together has a membership and registered supporter base of over 160 ca focal point for non-governmental organisations in Scotland on   2. Much of the evidence included in this submission is drawn from Rights reports for 2010 and 2011.ii This report provides a non-governmental perspective on the progress made in Scotland towards implementing the UNCRC.   The  report was compiled and produced by Togacross Scotland. The consultation involved gathering views and opinions from over 250 professionals working with and for children through seminars held in Ayr, Inverness, Aberdeen, the Scottish Borders and Edinburgh. This was followed by an online survey completed by 61 organisations working across a wide range of issues including mental health and wellbeing, disability, additional support needs, asylum and domestic abuse.   3. Togetherreflects on the progress made since the recommendations made to the UK Government in 2008 through the first session of the Universal Periodic Review. It also highlights additional key issues raised through the annual State of Child reports .   II.  PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS   A.   Cooperation with human rights mechanisms  Scope of international obligations   4. Much progress has been made with regard to the UK increasing its obligations under international treaties first session Universal Periodic Review.iii  In September 2008, the UK lifted its remaining reservations to the UNCRC on immigration and citizenship, meaning that children who are subject to immigration control are now entitled to the fundamental human rights set out in the CRC.  In February 2009 the UK Government ratified the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.  The UK ratified the UNCRPD in June 2009.  Despite such progress,  Together is concerned by current negative discourse around human rights in the UK and its potential impact on further progress.    Constitutional and legal reforms aimed at protecting human rights  UK Bill of Rights 5. In March 2011, the UK Government established an independent commission on a Bill of Rights to investigate the creation of a UK Bill of Rights. .  The commission is currently consulting about the need for a Bill of Rights and aims to report back to the UK  Together  Scott Submission for UPR UK (Scotland)  3 Government no later than by the end of 2012.   of reference refers only to the European Convention on Human Rights and not to the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA).  It is essential that any new Bill of Rights builds and strengthens the rights afforded by the HRA and does not seek to dilute or undermine the legal protection and opportunities for redress that it currently provides for people of all ages living in the UK. 6. The Bill of Rights could .  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child sees the development of a UK Bill of Rights as an opportunity to incorporate the principles and provisions of iv  The parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights came to a similar conclusion in its 2008 inquiry which stated that there was a v 7. Together, as part of the ROCK coalitionvi  has written to the Bill of Rights Commission to state the case for strengthening children's rights in the UK, urging the Commission to ensure that the needs and rights of children and young people are explicitly considered throughout all their investigations and strongly advocating that a UK Bill of Rights builds on and strengthens the existing HRA .  Recommendations:  The UK Government should ensure that a UK Bill of Rights builds on and strengthens the existing Human Rights Act  A UK Bill of Rights must incorporate the principles and provisions of the UNCRC throughout and include a    Incorporation of the UN treaties into law 8. None of the UN human rights treaties ratified by the UK have been incorporated into UK or Scots law.  The UK Government applies a piecemeal approach to the implementation of UN human rights treaties and as a result, many of the rights enshrined in these conventions have not been given legal effect in the UK.  There is much evidence that not all children living in the UK are able to fully realise their rights as enshrined in the UNCRC.  Scotland in terms of children accessing and experiencing many of the rights enshrined in the UNCRC.  Particular concerns have been raised on behalf of children with a disability, children affected by domestic violence and children affected by mental health issues, alongside refugee and asylum-seeking children and those living in poverty. vii  9. The UN Committee is clear that it expects governments to take all appropriate measures to give the UNCRC legal effect and has twice called for the UK Government to incorporate the rights, principles and provisions of the UNCRC into domestic law.viii    The committee is clear that incorporation n be directly invoked before the courts and ix and states must be available to redress violationsx  In the UK, the UNCRC has not been incorporated into domestic law and there are very few channels of redress for children facing violations of their rights.   Together  Scott Submission for UPR UK (Scotland)  4 10. In early 2011, the National Assembly for Wales unanimously passed the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure, demonstrating its commitment to strengthening rights protection for children in Wales. From 2014, the Measure will impose a duty upon Welsh Ministers to have due regard to the rights and obligations set out in the UNCRC and its Optional Protocols when exercising any of their functions. This will have strategic and day-to-day work of the Welsh Assembly Government. However, the measure does not amount to direct incorporation and opportunities for redress for children living in Wales are limited.  11. The Scottish Government has recently launched a consultation into a Rights of Children and Young People bill , similar to the Welsh measure, which will require Scottish Ministers to have due regard to the rights and obligations set out in the UNCRC and its Optional Protocols when exercising any of their functions.   Together welcomes the bill but is clear that it is not an alternative to incorporation of the UNCRC into Scots law. Together urges the Scottish Government to strengthen the bill by extending it to public bodies, ensuring it gives children a means of redress and clearly setting out how the Scottish Government intends to show its compliance with the UNCRC.   For the bill to be effective, the Scottish Government needs to accompany its introduction with a systematic and rigorous effort to promote knowledge and understanding of the UNCRC.  This must engage all sectors of society, from government officials, parliamentarians and the judiciary through to teachers, healthcare workers, the police and the media. It must ensure that all professionals working with and for children have a clear understanding of the UNCRC and how it relates to their role.  Together urges the Scottish Government to include a duty in the Rights of Children and Young People bill to promote awareness and understanding of the UNCRC.    Recommendations:  The UK Government should adopt as a matter of urgency appropriate legislative measures to give legal effect to human rights conventions in domestic law.    The UK and Scottish Government should seek to incorporate the UNCRC into domestic law at the earliest opportunity.   The Scottish Government should ensure that the Rights of Children and Young People Bill is extended to include public bodies, provides children with a means of redress and sets out how Government intends to show its compliance with the UNCRC. It must should also include a duty to promote knowledge and understanding of the UNCRC.    Institutional and human rights infrastructure  12. The Scottish Human Rights Commission was established by the Scottish Commission for Human Rights Act 2006 and started work in 2008. The Commission is independent of Government, and the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments.  Children and Young People  (SCCYP) with particular duties in relation to the UNCRC and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  SCCYP may carry out investigations into rights issues affecting either all children and young people, or particular groups of them, but cannot investigate matters that are reserved to the Westminster Parliament, such as immigration, asylum,  Together  Scott Submission for UPR UK (Scotland)  5 tax and welfare benefits. As a result, SCCYP cannot be said to fully comply with the Paris Principles.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child specifically called on the UK in 2008 to all four established commissioners are independent in compliance with the Paris Principles and mandated, inter alia, to receive and investigate complaints from or on behalf of children concerning xi   for Englandxii  also recommended to UK Government that Children's Commissioners across the UK should have the freedom to promote and protect all the rights of all children who live in their countries. Together would urge the UK Government to take this recommendation forward.   Recommendation  The UK and Scottish Governments should ensure legislation relating to the duties and powers of  across the UK are compliant with the Paris Principles.    B.  Implementation of Human Rights Obligations in Relation to Children  13. Analysis of Government action on the UPR recommendations of 2008 relating to children and young people has shown that there has been mixed progress in taking forward the recommendations. Further concerns have been identified through the  UN Committee on the xiii  and through nd.  Equality and non-discrimination  14. In 2008, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child raised a concern that disabilities continue to face barriers in the enjoyment of their rights guaranteed by the Convention, including in the right to xiv  There is continued concern  in Scotland about the lack of support and resources available to enable children with disabilities to enjoy their rights under the UNCRC.    15. For example, training for teachers and support staff in mainstream schools on additional support for learning, equalities and inclusion is not adequate in Scotland.  Only five local authorities provide mandatory training on equalities and inclusion, and none provide mandatory training on specific learning disability topics, e.g. autism or dyslexia.xv    In addition, the rights of children who are absent from school due to ill health are not protected in the same way across all areas in Scotland.xvi  As a result, children not being properly supported to learn in mainstream education, with the result that many parents are choosing to educate their child in specialist settings.    Recommendation  The Scottish Government should co-ordinate a national child rights training programme for professionals working with children with disabilities.    Together  Scott Submission for UPR UK (Scotland)  6 Right to life, liberty, and security of the person  Corporal punishment 16. consider further measures in order to address the problem of xvii  The UK did not respond to the further recommendation to    In 2008, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child reiterated its earlier recommendation that Scotland fully prohibit the physical discipline of children as a matter of priority, and actively promote the non-violent discipline of children.xviii    17. Despite such pressure, neither the UK nor Scottish Government has passed legislation to make all physical assault unlawful.   A recent large-scale NSPCC research study showed that 41.6% of the the past year.xix Between 1st April 2010 and 31st March 2011, ChildLine carried out a total of 265,458 counselling interactions with children and young people who had contacted the service with a range of concerns. 8,540 of these counselling interactions had a primary concern of physical abuse which represents 7% of the total counselling interactions that took place during that period. Physical abuse is consistently amongst the most common five problems that children and young people contact the ChildLine service about since its inception over two decades ago. Children talk hit with implements. A 2006 ChildLine study showed that one in three children talked about being bruised, wounded or hit with an implement, clearly indicating that the current law in Scotland is not protecting children and young people.   18. There will continue to be confusion between what is lawful and unlawful in relation to physical discipline within the family until clear legislation is passed.   The Scottish Government must challenge public perceptions about what constitutes normal or acceptable behaviour and encourage individuals to take responsibility for helping to protect vulnerable children in their school, street and community.  There is a need to remove the barriers that continue to stop people from acting on concerns they might have about a child, enabling society as a whole to challenge negative behaviour towards children, report suspected maltreatment, and ensure professionals act when concerns are raised.  Recommendation  The UK and Scottish Governments should make any form of physical violence against a person under the age of 18 a criminal offence.    Children affected by domestic violence 19. In the first session of the UPR, the UK accepted to commission on violence against women, to ensure greater coherence and more effective protection  xx   Although no such strategic oversight body has been set up, Scottish Government women and have paid particular attention to the needs of children affected by domestic violence as recommended by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2008.xxi   Together  Scott Submission for UPR UK (Scotland)  7 20. National Domestic Abuse Delivery Plan for Children and Young People, each local authority area.xxii  They have proved essential in helping children who have experienced domestic abuse make sense of their experiences and recover from the trauma of domestic abuse.  Now the funding for implementing the plan has ended, there is increasing concern about the continuity of these posts, particularly in light of the removal of ring-fenced funding.    21. and that there is a significant hidden population of children living with domestic abuse in Scotland.xxiii The outreach services provide by Women's Aid groups through the Children's Service Women's Aid Fund have gone some way to reaching out to these children.  The Delivery Plan has undoubtedly gone a long way to meeting the support needs of children experiencing domestic abuse.  The Scottish Government is urged to consider how tackling domestic abuse and ensuring the provision of specialist services can remain a priority now that the Delivery Plan has ended.  Recommendation  The UK and Scottish Governments should ensure that tackling domestic abuse remains high on the policy and funding agenda.    Right to social security and to an adequate standard of living  Child poverty 22. In the first session of the UPR, the UK accepted to xxiv However, there has been no progress in reducing the number of children living in severe poverty since 2004/05.xxv  organisations work with a wide range of children trapped in the cycle of poverty and recognise a wide range of contributing factors, the primary factor being the poverty of children living in workless households. Although there is a range of activity aimed at helping parents access the labour market, childcare is a serious barrier for many parents in terms of affordability, availability and quality.  23. Despite overall levels of homelessness falling by six per cent in Scotland over the last five years, there has been a seven per cent rise in the number of families with children who are being made homeless. More than one in 10 (128,000) children live in fuel poverty in Scotland.  The number of fuel-poor households with children rose by 23% in the last year because fuel costs rose faster than incomes.xxvi    24. In March 2011, the Scottish Government produced the first Child Poverty Strategy for Scotlandxxvii  to set out its commitment to tackling poverty and the socio-economic disadvantage of children.  strategy, particularly the focus on tackling the causes of poverty over the long-concerns including the lack of specific actions and timescales; ineffective monitoring and evaluation processes (and indicators)  and the lack of a gender focus.   Together  Scott Submission for UPR UK (Scotland)  8 25. Despite efforts being made to tackle child poverty at the Scottish level, there are serious concerns that the Welfare Reform Bill currently going through UK Parliament will disproportionately impact children and families. Modelling by the Institute of Fiscal Studies predicts that child poverty will increase in the next few years.xxviii   The welfare reform proposals also single out disabled people with an estimated £9.2 billion out of £18 billion in benefit savings coming from households containing a disabled adult or child.  The premium paid to families with a disabled child will be cut by 50% when the proposed new Universal Credit replaces existing benefits.xxix organisations are concerned that the reforms to the UK welfare system, alongside cuts in public spending, will both increase the numbers living in poverty and the depth of poverty they experience.  Recommendation  The UK and Scottish Governments should allocate the additional funds needed to meet the target of halving child poverty by 2010 as a matter of urgency.   Mental health 26. In 2008, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that additional resources and improved capacities should be employed  to meet the needs of children with mental health problems.xxx The Scottish Government has committed that by March 2013 no one will wait longer than 26 weeks from referral to treatment for specialist child and adolescent services (CAMHS)xxxi. However, there is an overwhelming opinion among childreprovision of CAMHS is inadequate.xxxii  Although the quality of CAMHS is generally thought to be good, it is hugely under-resourced, leading to long waiting lists that can cause more damage to the child as well as longer, and ultimately more expensive, treatment.     27. The numbers of children admitted to adult psychiatric wards in Scotland has increased despite a specific target to reduce this.xxxiii  This is due to a lack of sufficient beds in appropriate settings and a lack of clinreceive specialist services or take part in social activities and may often have their education disrupted.  Particular concerns have been raised about the lack of CAMHS services for vulnerable children including asylum seeking children, children of prisoners and children from ethnic minorities.   Recommendation  The Scottish Government should ensure that sufficient resources and capacities are employed to meet the needs of children with mental health problems with particular attention given to services for vulnerable groups such as asylum-seeking children, children of prisoners and children from ethnic minority communities.   Migrants, refugees, and asylum-seekers  28. In the first session of the UPR, the UK accepted to  xxxiv  However, there is great concern awith regard to  Together  Scott Submission for UPR UK (Scotland)  9 violations of the rights of asylum-seeking children, specifically relating to the training of staff and the availability of legal representation.   Training of case owners 29. Processing Asylum Applications from a Childxxxv, is to be commended for its explicit and detailed references to the principles of the UNCRC and reference to in Scotland shows that the principles of UKBA policy and guidance are yet to be realised in UKBA practice.  They recommend that the UKBA involves organisations such as the Scottish Refugee Council, British Red Cross and Freedom From Torture in the training of case owners, including real-life scenarios facing children, to ensure that the case owners fully understand specific issues and considerations in cases involving children.  Availability of legal representation 30. There are significant concerns about the availability of legal representation to asylum-seeking children. Only one law firm in Scotland has specific funding to work with children which is partly subsidised through independent trust funding. There was a call for specific funding to be made available by the Scottish Government to provide legal representation for asylum-seeking children, along with a call for the Law Society Scotland to introduce an accreditation scheme similar to the Immigration and Asylum Accreditation scheme run by the Law Society in England, in order to ensure a quality standard among legal professionals.xxxvi  Recommendations  The UK Government should ensure guidance for those working with refugee and asylum seeking children around the best interests of the child is followed in practice.   The UK and Scottish Governments should take steps to ensure that adequate high quality specialised legal representation is in place for children seeking asylum and for protecting and representing the victims of child trafficking.

39,JS11 - Joint Submission 11," 1 Submission to the United Nations Universal Periodic Review of the United Kingdom (U.K.)   Submission on behalf of:  Indigenous Peoples Links (PIPLinks) and Middlesex University Dept. of Law (U.K.)1  Submission focus: U.K. responsibility to ensure respect for the rights of indigenous peoples overseas in the context of UK transnational corporations (TNC) activities impacting on them.2  Relevant International Human Rights instruments and associated provisions:  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR): Articles 1, 25 and 27 and General Comment 25 - right to self-determination, right to participation and right to culture (including rights to way of life & traditional economic & social activities)  International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR): Articles 1, 11 and 15 - rights to self-determination, adequate standard of living (including the right to food and water) and the right to culture.  International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD): Articles 2, 5 and 6 and General Recommendation 23  right to non-discrimination, to participation, to property (including lands, territories and resources) and the requirement to obtain free prior and informed consent.   United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UN DRIP): Articles 3, 4, 26 and 32 - right to self-determination, autonomy and self-government; right to lands, territories and resources; right to development and the requirement to consult and co-operate in good faconsent in the context of extractive projects impacting upon them.                                                             1  For details of the submitting organizations see: http://www.piplinks.org/; http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/Schools/business_school/departments/law/index.aspx; Contacts Andrew Whitmore whit@piplinks.com & Cathal Doyle: doncathal@gmail.com 2   This submission draws on the submission made to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 79th Session (8 August - 2 September 2011) which was made by the submitting organizations in conjunction with Down to Earth and the London Mining Network.   2 Context: 1. In its 2011 concluding observations to the UK the UN Committee on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) noted its concerns with regard to:   party but conducted outside the territory of the State party that affect the rights of indigenous peoples to land, health, environment and an adequate standard of living. The Committee further regrets the introduction of a legislative bill in the State party which, if passed, will courts against such  2. The CERD recalled its general recommendation No. 23 (1997) on the rights of indigenous peoples, and recommended that the U.K  o ensure that acts of transnational corporations registered in the State party comply with the provisions of the Convention. In this regard, the Committee recommends that the State party should ensure that no obstacles are introduced in the law that prevent the holding of such transnational corporations party. The Committee reminds the State party to sensitize corporations registered in its territory to their social   3.  This submission focuses on the need for greater control and accountability from UK-based extractive companies which impact on Indigenous Peoples overseas. It offers A) a series of potential questions and recommendations for the U.K. in relation to this issue, B) background on the issue and C) an  appendix which outlines a number of case studies where these impacts have been felt, including cases where action is urgently needed to prevent future violations.  Suggested questions: 4. In light of the recommendation by the UN CERD to the U.K. Government, what measures does the U.K government envisage to give effect to the 2011 recommendations of the UN CERD?  Specifically does it have a plan to develop the necessary legislative and administrative measures to ensure that acts of transnational corporations registered in the U.K. comply with the provisions of the ICERD, the ICCPR, the ICESCR, the UN DRIP and are consistent with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights developed by the UN Special Representative Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the Issue of Human Rights and Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises, Professor John Ruggie?    3 5. What mechanisms or avenues does it envisage in order to afford impacted indigenous peoples with the potential to hold these transnational corporations to account for contributing toward violations of their rights?  Specifically would it consider: i. requiring extractive companies, and public or private investors funding them, to have policies in place, consistent with these human rights standards, which seek to guarantee that their activities and investments do not contribute to discrimination against Indigenous Peoples.3 ii. addressing the absence of independent monitoring processes that can receive complaints from Indigenous Peoples, and which have the capacity to conduct investigations leading to enforceable sanctions.  iii. making appropriate provision for indigenous communities to exercise the right to engage with such processes through the provision of adequate legal aid. iv. strengthening corporate reporting and disclosure requirements with regard to 4 v. ratifying ILO Treaty 169 and ensuring that UK registered companies, and those funded by UK investments, operate in a manner consistent with it, and the UN DRIP.  vi. seeking to use its position as a member of the World Bank Board to ensure that the World Bank is compliant with international human rights standards in relation to respect for the rights of Indigenous Peoples. Specifically, encouraging the public sector arm of the World Bank to update its policies to include recognition of the requirement for Free Prior and Informed Consent, in line with the revised Financial Corporation (IFC). Background: 6. A significant number of United Kingdom (UK) registered transnational companies have operations within indigenous territories around the world in the extractive (mining, oil and gas), fisheries and agriculture sectors. Operations associated with all of these sectors have resulted in violations of Indigenous Peoples' rights.5 However, extractive sector operations                                                            3  Thabroad serve the economic, social and cultural rights in the host countrieE/C.12/DEU/CO/5, para. 10. 4 http://www.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/ruggie/weil-memo-re-guiding-principles-11-jan-2011.pdf 5  See appendix for some examples in Asia, Africa, North and South America.   4 violations constitute a disproportionately high percentage of them.6 These extractive companies registered in the UK are largely funded by UK registered banks, finance companies, and institutional investors, including pension funds and insurance companies. is the reason why such a large number of extractive companies are registered in the UK.7 7. The impact of UK-based investments is therefore significant and widespread, affecting Indigenous Peoples across the globe (see appendix 1 for examples).8 Regulating the activities of the UK-based extractive and financial sectors, in accordance with international human rights standards, is therefore an essential pillar of efforts to establish safeguards against the widespread violations of Indigenous Peoples' rights. The extant policies and practices of extractive companies are inconsistent with the UN DRIP and human rights standards. In addition there exists a paucity of standards and policies in the mainstream UK  8. One mechanism which may offer some guidance to the UK Government is ILO Convention 169 on Tribal and Indigenous Peoples Rights. However, the UK Government has so far failed to ratify it. The UK Government endorsed the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UN DRIP) in 2007, but in a statement of explanation offered the view that it was not applicable to the UK as there were no Indigenous Peoples within the UK, ignoring the international obligations associated with endorsement of the UNDRIP. Indeed the UK Government has consistently failed to provide effective monitoring or any adequate safeguards to ensure that UK registered companies (both extractive and financial) comply require it to ensure that these companies have appropriate policies in place, examine their human rights records and where a history of violations exists deny them a UK registration.9 9. A number of UK-based companies, and companies with significant UK investments, have failed, and continue to fail, to live up to these standards in practice. This trend is                                                            6   John Ruggie, Interim Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the Issue of Human Rights and Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises, U.N. Doc. - oil, gas and mining - utterly dominates this sample of reported with two thirds of the total.... The extractive industries also account for most allegations of the worst abuses, up to and including complicity in crimes against humanity.  These are typically for acts committed by public and private security forces protecting company assets and property; large-scale corruption; violations of labour rights; and a broad array of abuses in relation to  7 For example most of the major mining companies including Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, Xstrata, Vedanta and Anglo American are registered in the U.K.. An overview of mining finance, as well as individual examples, are available from:- http://moneytometal.org/ 8  The scale of mining related investments conducted in the U.K. is evidenced by trading activity on the London Metal Exchange which is estimated to be $11.6 Trillion a year. 9  Nostromo Research, London, City of Spoils: UK mining companies and the case for stricter oversight. A draft report for London Mining Network by Nostromo Research, June 2011   5 expected to increase, particularly in the energy and extractive sectors as demand increases for remaining resources, often located in indigenous territories. Increased investment in these sectors is in general correlated with high risk of potentially profound negative impacts on life.10  10. In addition to providing funding to the global operations of UK based TNCs, these extractive sector-based investment opportunities are also a major source of revenue for the UK economy.  This fact that the UK economy is directly profiting from these rights violating activities should place, in addition to its legal obligations under the Convention, a significant moral burden on the State to design the measures necessary to protect against such occurrences, to monitor for them and to sanction them where they occur.  11. In this context, and in light of the recommendations made by the CERD it is suggested that the UK be given guidance in relation to the importance of, and potential on the enthat they are held to account.11                                                             10  See Appendix for examples of U.K. Companies which have impacted or are currently impacting on indigenous peoples enjoyment of their rights. 11   CERD/C/CAN/CO/18 para 17; CERD/C/USA/CO/6 para 30 & CERD/C/NOR/CO/19-20 para territories outside Norway, including impact on their way of life and on the environment, of the activities by transnational corporations domiciled in the territory and/or under the jurisdiction of Norway.

In particular, the State party should explore ways to hold transnational corporations domiciled in the territory and/or under the jurisdiction of Norway accountable for any adverse impacts on the

Drawing on research conducted by the Open Society Justice Initiative and Stopwatch since the United oncerns with provisions contained in three legislative acts in the UK, which perpetuate the use of ethnic profiling by police as a matter of daily practice in regular law enforcement, and increasingly, under exceptional powers ostensibly to combat terrorism. These provisions, and the continued they allow, obligations regarding non-discrimination, right to freedom of movement and the right to an effective remedy. These rights are protected under the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination also contravene its regional human rights obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and Charter of Fundamental Rights.  In outlining concerns about these laws and practices, this submission will address the   which the UK accepted  review all counter-  2. The Open Society Justice Initiative uses law to protect and empower people around the world. Through litigation, advocacy, research, and technical assistance, the Justice Initiative promotes human rights and builds legal capacity for open societies. The Justice Initiative has monitored stop and search practices in the UK for six years, advocating for legal and policy reform to address its discriminatory effects.   3. StopWatch is an action group formed of leading organisations from civil society, the legal profession and academia in the UK. StopWatch aims to ensure the fair and effective use of stop and search powers to promote safety and positive police community relations. Participating organisations include Equinomics UK, Federation of Student Islamic Societies (FOSIS), Ipswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality (ISCRE), Manheim Centre for Criminology, London School of Economics, Muslim Safety Forum, NACRO, Not Another Drop, Release, Runnymede Trust, School of Law, Kings College London, Second Wave, and Turning Point.  4. Our central requests are that the UPR Working Group recommend that the UK:    Review the discriminatory both regular law enforcement and counter-terrorism legislation;   Institute legislative amendments to eliminate disproportionate targeting of ethnic minorities and ensure all powers meet the highest human rights standards in law and practice; and    Reinstate full recording of stop and search powers to ensure an avenue for an effective remedy of rights violations and scope for local community monitoring.              2 BACKGROUND   5. British police have legal powers to stop and search members of the public who they suspect may have committed, or are about to commit, an offence.  In practice, these powers excessively target ethnic minorities.  Concerns about the disproportionate targeting of ethnic and religious minorities  particularly Muslims  in stops and searches, were raised in the counter-terrorism efforts by the Government officials as well as the abuse of counter-terrorism laws which are 1  6.  Still today, refers to the use by law enforcement officials of generalizations grounded in ethnicity, race, religion, or national originrather than objective evidence or individual behavioras the basis for making law enforcement and/or investigative decisions about who has been or may be involved in criminal activity.2 The  stop and search powers in 2010 concluded that a number of police forces are using the powers in a manner that is disproportionate and possibly discriminatory.3  7.  in the United Kingdom is embodied in various pieces of legislation that are regulated by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) Code of Practice A.  The vast majority of stop and searches are carried out under the auspices of three Acts - PACE 1984 (section 1), Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (section 23) and the Firearms Act 1968 (section 47).  The use of exceptional stop and search powers that do not have the safeguard of reasonable suspicion  and which are contained in Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and Section 47a and Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000  has       8. laws and practices are frequently justified on the basis of countering terrorism, adverting potential violence or preventing and detecting crime.  During its 2008 Review by the Human Rights Council, the UK responded to concerns about the use of ethnic profiling by denying any subjective stereotyping in the use of stop and search powers by police. It stated that  stop and search power is intelligence-led, and is more likely to be effective and to secure public confidence if based on up-to-date intelligence and on an rists and 4 Yet rather than targeting terrorists and criminals, stop and search powers have cast a wide net over thousands of innocent persons.  Moreover, changes in law and policy since 2008 have resulted in less elligence- to policing, and greater reliance on ethnic stereotyping in conducting stops and searches  with fewer accountability mechanisms to place a check on discriminatory abuse.    RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS BREACHED BY ETHNIC PROFILING PRACTICES  9. Protection against ethnic profiling is contained in at least three international human rights conventions to which the UK is a party: the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination                                                  1 Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, May 23, 2008, U.N. Doc A/HRC/8/25 at 10. 2 ce practice in which a defined set of characteristics is used to look for and apprehend someone who has committed a crime (criminal profiling) or to identify people likely to engage in criminal activity (behavioral profiling).  3 Equalities and Human Rights Commission (2010), Stop and Think: A Critical Review of the Use of Stop and Search Powers in England and Wales. London: EHRC. 4 Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, May 23, 2008, U.N. Doc A/HRC/8/25 at page 11.             3 (CERD).  Regional human rights obligations offering similar protections include the  European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR).     10. The general prohibition against discrimination based on race or ethnicity is most comprehensively set out in the CERD, but is also protected under all other relevant international and regional human rights instruments to which the UK is a party.5 racial discrimination against persons, groups of persons or institutions and to ensure that all public authorities and public institutionsor nullify any laws and regulations which have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination compliance with its non-discrimination discriminatory legislation required by CERD Article 2(1)(c) has, in effect, paved the way for police and other public authorities to use their discretionary powers in a way that discriminated against ethnic minorities, violating CERD Article 2(1)(a).  This lack of compliance is relevant not only for the everyday use of ethnic profiling in regular law enforcement, but also for the use of extraordinary powers which facilitate the use of ethnic profiling to combat terrorism an issue of concern to the Human Ri.   10.  The right to freedom of movement, protected under CERD Article 5(d)(i) as well as UDHR Article 13,  has been limited by legitimate national security restrictions   ICCPR article Such legitimate restrictions, however, must also be consistent with other ICCPR rights, which includes the ICCPR Article 2 right not to be discriminated against on account of, inter alia, race. The disproportionate targeting of minorities in stop and search practices in the UK fails to comply with the non-discrimination requirement underpinning the use of legitimate national security restrictions on the right to freedom of movement.  11. The right to an effective remedy is protected by UDHR Article 8, ICCPR Article 2(3), EHRC Article 13, CERD Article 6 and CFR Article 47. One avenue to ensure effective protection and remedies to persons whose rights have been violated through discriminatory stop and search practices was highlighted by the CERD Committee in its September 2011 Concluding Observations on the UK.  It recommended that the UK ensure that all stops are properly recorded, whether or not leading to searches, and  that  a copy of the record  is  provided to the person  concerned for all  such incidents in order  to safeguard the rights of  those subject to these laws and to check  possible  abuse.provide victims of ethnic profiling with a mechanism through which to seek remedy from the complaints system and ultimately the courts.     12. 6 on counter-terrorism laws his submission contends that legislative reviews by the UK to date have not had the effect of eliminating ethnic discrimination in the use of exceptional stop and search powers designed to combat terrorism particularly in relation to the Terrorism Act 2000.  Moreover, further review and amendment of legislation governing the regular use of stop and search in everyday policing, such as the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, is also required to ensure the UK stops violating its international human rights obligations. Each of these laws perpetuates discrimination against ethnic minorities.    OBLIGATIONS  13. This submission analyses stop and search powers under three main laws - the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, and ends with a review of the weakening of accountability mechanism and the lack of avenues for redress.                                                    5 These include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) (Article 2), The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (Article 2), the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) (Article 14) and the Charter on Fundamental Rights (Article 21).             4  A. The Terrorism Act 2000   14. Despite recent amendments to counter-terrorism legislation designed to reduce the risk of discrimination in stop and search powers, changes have not gone far enough to ensure compliance with human rights standards.  Two sets of provisions within the Terrorism Act 2000 continue to be a cause for concern:  Sections 47a (which replaced sections 44(1) and (2)) and Schedule 7.    15. Sections 44(1) and (2) allowed police officers to stop and search vehicles and pedestrians for articles that could be used for terrorism even without reasonable suspicion that such articles are present within an authorised area.  The discretion allowed under Section 44 has resulted in the disproportionate targeting of ethnic minorities. In 2009-10, 35 per cent of Section 44 stop and searches were conducted on people from black and minority ethnic groups even though they make up less than 10 per cent of the national population.6  A 2010 European Court of Human Rights judgment concerning these provisions, in the case of Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, 7 Finding a violation of the right to respect for private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the Court also noted the clear risk of arbitrariness in the granting of such broad discretion to police officers. It highlighted the risks of discriminatory use of such powers, given that the available statistics demonstrating that black and Asian people were disproportionately affected by the powers.8 The Gillan decision also noted that stop and search under Section 44 amounted to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 § 1.9  16. violation, the UK Secretary of State introduced Section 47(a) (replacing Section 44) in the Terrorism Act 2000 (Remedial) Order 2011 on March 18, 2011.10 Under this new order, police are still allowed to stop and search individuals in a defined area without reasonable suspicion if an act of terrorism is reasonably suspected, and stop and search is deemed necessary to prevent such an act. This new Order also provides that officers exercising the stop and search powers may only do so for the purpose of searching for evidence that the person concerned is a terrorist or that the vehicle concerned is being use for the purposes of terrorism. A senior officer must take the decision to authorize this power for as long as deemed necessary, but no longer than 14 days. The senior officer must seek confirmation from the Secretary of State who can modify the length and area the authorization covers.   17. In June 2011, however, the UK Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights found that the new Order did not go far enough to protect human rights.11 The Committee recommended that more safeguards needed to be put in place to curb the degree of discretion that could lead to discriminatory application of the Order.  These safeguards included the requirement for the senior belief (as opposed to suspicion) as to the necessity of the authorization for stop and search; for authorizations to be renewed only in cases in which new or additional information emerges or a fresh assessment confirms the original intelligence that the threat remains immediate and credible; that prior judicial authorization of the availability of the power to stop and search without reasonable suspicion should be required; and that the Code of Practice accompanying the Order should contain stronger recording and public notification requirements to facilitate monitoring and supervision of the use of the power.                                                      6 Ministry of Justice (2011), Police Powers and Procedures England and Wales 2009-2010, Second Edition, London: Ministry of Justice. 7 ECtHR, Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, Application no. 4158/05, judgment of January 12, 2010, at 87 8 Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, at 85.

In July 2011, the report of the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, David Anderson QC, assessed the operation of the Terrorism Act 2000. His report raised concerns that the discretion conferred on individual officers under both the Remedial Order and the accompanying Code of Practice, remained too broad. Such discretion, the report argued, continued to carry the risk of arbitrariness that concerned the European Court of Human Rights in Gillan.12 Anderson was particularly concerned about the continued scope for random searches by police, and the lack of definition of the circumstances in which random searches are appropriate.   19. In July 2011, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, rejected the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Independent Review, and refused to amend the Remedial Order. Meanwhile, a second report issued by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in September 2011 again called for a new order to bring section 47a in compliance with ECHR.13  Such changes are both urgent and necessary in light of the disproportionate impact these provisions have had on ethnic minorities.    20. Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 is of equal, if not greater, concern. It was not considered in the 2010 parliamentary review of counter terrorism and operates outside of the regulatory framework that covers other police stop and search powers. Schedule 7 provides stop and search powers in ports and airports where  detain people, without the need for any reasonable suspicion, to ascertain whether they are likely to be engaged in acts of terrorism. Individuals stopped under the power may be detained and examined for up to nine hours during which they may be questioned, strip-searched, have their belongings searched and have samples of their DNA and fingerprints taken. Although those detained under the power are not under arrest, they are obliged to co-operate and answer questions in the absence of a lawyer or risk bei14 The Gillan decision noted that stops and searches under section 44 that lasted up to 30 minutes amounted to a deprivation of liberty that is, a significantly  shorter time period than allowed under Schedule 7.    21. The potential for discretionary abuse of this provision against ethnic minorities is significant  and has been demonstrated in practice.  Recent figures show that 65,684 people were stopped under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 in 2010/11. However, the overall arrest rate remains very low at 1.4 per cent.15 Black and minority ethnic groups make up the majority of those subject to Schedule 7 stops even though they account for a small minority (approximately 10 per cent) of the national population. Asians accounted for 30 per cent of Schedule 7 stops (and five per cent of the national population), Blacks accounted for nine per cent of stops (and accounted for 20 per cent of stops (but only three per cent of the population).   The targeting of black and minority ethnic groups continues to be even more marked when we consider the most intensive Schedule 7 stops. Of those stops which lasted over an hour, 46 per cent were of Asians, 15 per cent were of blacks and 24 . Fewer than 15 per cent of stops were of whites.16   22. movement, it is worth analyzing the extent to which such limitations are permissible in the context of national security concerns.  General Comment No. 27 on the Freedom of Movement highlights that permissible restrictive measures, such as ones based in national security concerns,                                                    12 Report on the Operation in 2012 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and of Part 1 of the Terrorism Act 2006 (July 2011) Presented to Parliament pursuant to s.36 of the Terrorism Act 2006. 13Parliamentary Human Rights Joint Committee, The Terrorism Act 2000 (Remedial) Order 2011: Stop and Search without Reasonable Suspicion (second Report), 6thSeptember 2011.  14 Schedule 7of the Terrorism Act 2000 and accompanying Codes of Practice allow a person detained under this power the right to request the presence of a solicitor, but the police are not obliged to wait for their arrival and, as is often the case ,the police can press on with the search and questioning of the individual. Since it is an offense for the detained individual to refuse to cooperate with the search and questioning they are automatically deprived from their right to legal representation during the encounter. Ironically, the right to legal representation is afforded to actual terrorist suspects arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 but not for innocent people detained at UK ports and airports under Schedule 7 even though they are never suspected of being involved in acts of terrorism. 15 Home Office (2011) Operation of police powers under the Terrorism Act 2000 and subsequent legislation: Arrests, outcomes and stops and searches Great Britain 2010/11, London: Home Office. 16 Home Office (2011).            6 must conform to the principle of proportionality; they must be appropriate to achieve their protective function; they must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result; and they must be proportionate to the interest law that frames the restrictions, but also by the administrative and judicial authorities in applying the law.17     The disproportionate targeting of ethnic minorities in Schedule 7 stops breaches this fundamental norm governing the application of legitimate national security restrictions on freedom of movement.  Non-discrimination is a non-derogable norm, even in times of terrorism.  Based on current statistics of the targets of Schedule 7 powers, non-discrimination obligations.   23. In summary, the legal framework and practice of Schedule 7 stops discriminate against ethnic minorities and violate the right to freedom of movement and to non-discrimination under the CERD, ICCPR, CFR and ECHR. The law should establish a minimum threshold of suspicion on the basis of which individuals can be stopped under Schedule 7. The threshold should be based upon objective facts, information, and/or intelligence, so as to minimize the risk of arbitrary and/or discriminatory application of these stop and search powers.   B. Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994  24.  Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 is a provision designed to provide an exceptional response to anticipated violence. Section 60 allows for police to be authorized to search any person or vehicle for weapons in an area where serious violence is reasonably anticipated.  This authorization lasts 24 time and place, it does not require police to have any individualized basis of reasonable suspicion.18  25. Under Section 60, police have the widest discretion and limited safeguards allowing them to utilise generalisations and stereotypes about who is involved in crime rather than objective information. Ministry of Justice data shows higher rates of disproportional stops of ethnic minorities for powers that do not require reasonable suspicion. The rate of stops and searches conducted under Section 60 for black people is 29 times the rate for white people, and for Asian people it is seven times the rate for whites.19  In addition, an investigation conducted by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) into the use of Section 60 stop and search powers in the West Midlands in 2007 confirmed concerns that Section 60 was being used inappropriately to deal with routine crime problems. There was no justifiable reason why normal police powers based on reasonable suspicion were not being used.20  Continuous repeat authorisations under Section 60 have been used to subject certain areas to virtually permanent use of the power to stop and search without reasonable suspicion, in much the same manner as the European Court of Human Rights found to be an abuse of Section 44 of the Terrorism Act in the case of Gillan. Hence, a power that was intended to respond to exceptional outbreaks of violence is now being routinely and extensively used against black and Asian communities across the UK.  26. In summary, the legal framework governing Section 60 stop and searches discriminates against ethnic minorities and violates CERD Articles 2(1)(a) and (c). The manner in which Section 60 has been applied in practice violates Article 5 and UDHR Articles 2 and 7. An independent review is necessary to determine why a power without reasonable suspicion is needed. The legislation must be amended to ensure that Section 60 authorizations can only be renewed in cases in which new or additional information, or a fresh assessment of                                                  17 United Nations Human Rights Committee,  UN Doc CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.9, November 2, 1999, at paras 14-15. 18 Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 as amended by Section 8 of the Knives Act Subsection 3 allows a superintendent to extend this authorization for a further 24 hours. 19 Ministry of Justice (2011), Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System - 2010, London: Ministry of Justice. 20 Independent Police Complaints Commission (2007) Report into West Midlands Police Misuse of Section 60 Powers.            7 the original intelligence, confirms that the threat remains immediate and credible; that authorizations should be subject to judicial and external review; and the Code of Practice should contain stronger recording and public notification requirements to facilitate monitoring and supervision of the use of the power.     C.   Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984  27. -going concern with UK legislation designed to anticipate and prevent serious violence, legislation in which Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (section 1), Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (section 23) and the Firearms Act 1968 (section 47)  all governed by the PACE Code of Practice A  fall into this category.  Most stop and searches are conducted under these provisions.  28. National statistics show that under ordinary stop and search powers black people are stopped and searched by the police at seven times the rate of whites, while Asians are stopped and searched at more than twice the rate of whites across England and Wales.21 Analysis conducted by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) in 2010 concluded that a number of police forces are using the powers in a manner that is disproportionate and possibly discriminatory. The EHRC assessed how many more stops and searches are conducted on black and Asian people than would be the case if they were stopped and searched at the same rate as white people. In 2007-08, there were 145,000 22    29.  In 200910, 1,141,839 stops and searches were conducted in England and Wales.23 Yet, the rate of arrests resulting from those stop and searches was only nine per cent.24 This raises the question of how well stop and search is being targeted. The evidence shows that out of every 100 recorded stop and searches based on  do not result in an arrest for the behaviour suspected, or for any other reason. The impact of this practice on ethnic minorities is striking. In comparison to e process as a 25 Secondly, as the arrest rate resulting from stop and search is similar for all groups, seven times as many innocent black people and twice as many innocent Asian people are searched in comparison to their white counterparts.26   30.   We support this Observation, and further recommend that effective external oversight needs to be put in place to hold individual police forces to account for their use of the powers and the extent to which they disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. Such measures should be accompanied by further practical guidance for officers and ensure that the threshold of reasonable suspicion is a meaningful safeguard.    D.      Undermining of stop and search accountability mechanisms  31. In March 2011, the UK government removed the requirement of recording of all 27 This fundamentally weakens existing accountability structures and the ability for victims to seek redress. This weakening has been facilitated through amendments to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) Code of Practice A, which governs the use and recording of stop and search. reduThe Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) was                                                  21 Ministry of Justice (2011), Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System - 2010, London: Ministry of Justice. 22 Equalities and Human Rights Commission (2010) Stop and Think: A Critical Review of the Use of Stop and Search Powers in England and Wales. London: EHRC. 23 Ministry of Justice (2011). 24 Ministry of Justice (2011). 25 Home Affairs Select Committee (2009). The Macpherson Report - Ten Years On, session 2008  2009. 26 Home Affairs Select Committee (2008) Young Black Men and the Criminal Justice System, Second Report of Session 200607 27 The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 Code of Practice, 7th March 2011.            8 originally introduced in 1984 with the aim of setting national minimum standards which would cover the country as a whole.  It was partly introduced to end t saw wildly varied powers and recording standards used by different forces. The most recent amendments were made with no public consultation and little assessment of the impact on ethnic minority communities. There is a danger that the different policing areas.   26. Under these changes, individual police forces have the discretion to choose whether they will continue to record the name and address of the person searched, whether any injury or damage was caused as a result of the search and whether anything was found as a consequence of the search. The failure to record the name of the person stopped on the form makes it imp as outlawed in the UK Equality Act 2010. There are long standing concerns about repeat stop and searc certain individuals or communities, and without recording the name of the person stopped it will be difficult to assess the validity of these concerns and to use legal avenues to remedy it. Equally, the removal of the recording of whether there was any injury or damaged caused as a result of the search makes it impossible to measure any misuse of force. It also leaves the police open to complaints about use of force or malicious damage that cannot be substantiated and those individuals stopped unable to demonstrate injury or damage and seek redress.   with police   of the public and ask them to account for their actions, behaviour or presence in an area but do not go on to search them.  The recent changes to PACE remove previous regulatory requirements for the police to record all stops. Police forces may reinstate the recording of stop and account when there are local concerns about the disproportionate use of stops, but the decision rests entirely in police hands, denying local communities a role in decision-making. The removal of a legal requirement to record stops means that it is possible that such stops will not be recorded, making it impossible for communities to demonstrate there are local concerns in order to require police forces to reinstate recording.   In an important positive development, the London Metropolitan Police Service decided in September 2011 to keep recording stop and accounts. The MPS stop and accounts represent approximately half of stop and accounts recorded nationally.  However, other police forces throughout the country are yet to follow suit, raising concerns that individuals outside the MPS jurisdiction will not have an avenue to demonstrate discriminatory practices and hence seek an effective remedy to rights violations.     2003 Concluding Observations for the UK, it noted its concern about the disproportionate stop and searches directed at ethnic minorities, the record form was given to the person concerned.28 These recommendations were ignored and in its 2011 Concluding Observations, the Committee again recommended that all stops are properly recorded, whether or not leading to searches, and that a copy of the record is provided to the person concerned for all such incidents in order to safeguard the rights of the people subject to these laws and to check possible abuse. The Committee warned may not only encourage racial and ethnic stereotyping by police officers but may also encourage impunity and fail to promote accountability in the police service for possible 29                                                    28 Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, U.N.

The Justice Initiative and StopWatch urges the UPR Working Group on Human Rights to address ethnic profiling in stop and search when it conducts its Universal Periodic Review of the United Kingdom. In would clarify the following:   What measures are being taken to eliminate racial discrimination in policing by reducing the     In light of the concerns of the UK Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights and Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation with respect to the new section 47a power, without changes to the Order and Code of Practice how can the power be made EHRC compliant?  In the light of the ECHR decision in Gillan, what steps does the UK government now intend to take to review other powers to stop and search without reasonable suspicion under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act and Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000?  Without recording the use of stops, how will communities be able to demonstrate concerns about disproportionate and ineffective use?  Without recording the names of individuals stopped and searched, how can those who perceive themselves to be unfairly targeted produce evidence of discrimination under the Equality Act 2010?  30. In its recommendations, we urge the UPR working group to ask the UK to:   Publicly acknowledge the problem of ethnic profiling in stop and search and commit to reducing its disproportionate use against ethnic minority communities.  This should include the setting of targets for the reduction of disproportionality and a timeline for achieving this goal;  Conduct an independent review into the legal framework and use of Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000,  the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 with a specific focus on any discriminatory impacts;  Amend existing legislation governing the exceptional powers of section 47a and Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to ensure it is compatible with its international obligations under the ECHR,  CERD, ICCPR and CFR, and that the legislation contains adequate legal safeguards against arbitrary and discriminatory use;  Amend the Code of Practice for use of stop and search under Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to strengthen the safeguard of reasonable suspicion to ensure it is a meaningful constraint on police behavior;  Accept CERD Recommendation 18 and reinstate the national requirement that police forces fully record all there is effective oversight of the data and local community monitoring;   Recommend a range of further steps to address ethnic profiling in practice, including through judicial and disciplinary accountability and oversight of police practices as well as through clear commitment and a comprehensive action plan.

Founded over 40 years ago, we have pioneered work to animate and promote human rights. We work with civil society organisations and the public sector, equipping them to translate human rights principles and laws into living and practical tools for change. For further information about BIHR visit www.bihr.org.uk  1  Introduction 1. In this submission the 44 undersigned NGOs seek to assist the UN in assessing the United we set out our concerns about the way in which recent political and institutional developments risk undermining the framework for human rights protection in the UK. We Human Rights Act will be preserved and built upon in any efforts to develop this framework. In Section 2 we analyse a number of other issues which we believe need to be explored in  2. We outline the concern we all share regarding the narrative on human rights in the UK. This narrative is negative, misleading and undermines our fundamental rights and freedoms. This assessed.  Methodology  3. The British Institute of human Rights (BIHR), received funding from the Equality and Human Right, to undertake awareness-raising on the UPR with civil society. BIHR facilitated two events in England (Leeds and London) and one in Wales (Cardiff), involving about 70 representatives of national and local NGOs.  4. BIHR spoke at various additional NGO forums about the UPR, and the UPR process was weeks to promote the 16 rights of the Human Rights Act.  5. The views expressed in this submission are those of BIHR and the other co-signatories.  SECTION 1 Normative and institutional frameworks 6. Although the UK has ratified most international human rights treaties, there are some notable omissions that need to be addressed when attempting rights record and performance. Firstly, the UK has not ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, or the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. We recommend the UK signs up to these treaties, to signal the importance the UK places on upholding universal human rights standards. Secondly, the UK has not ratified the optional protocols to, for example, the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which allow individual petitions. We believe this right is an important safeguard which plays an important role in building engagement between the UN system and civil society. We recommend that the UK moves swiftly to ratify these two protocols. Thirdly, some of the declarations and reservations remain problematic and should be reviewed with a view to their withdrawal. T 2  declaration to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OPAC) is described by the UK as an of article 2 of OPAC it is tantamount to acting as a reservation, and it has not been reviewed or removed following the recommendation of the previous UPR1.   Constitutional and legislative frameworks  7. The UK is a constitutional monarchy with an unwritten constitution, to the extent that there is no single law which sets out thdualist system of law. As a result, the human rights obligations accepted by the UK through ratification of international or regional human rights treaties do not create domestically enforceable ri by a principle of the common law or a specific Act of Parliament.  8. A dramatic change came about when the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) entered into force in the UK in 2000. The HRA made directly enforceable in the UK most of the rights set out in the European Convention of Human Rights (the Convention rights), which the UK had ratified over 50 years earlier. The Convention rights are to a large extent equivalent to most (but certainly not all) of the rights set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  9. The rights set out within the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are not in the main directly enforceable in the UK, and we would recommend that steps are taken to remedy this. 10. Understanding the nature and role of the HRA is fundamental to any attempt to assess the are required to observe the Convention rights in all that they do and in all decisions that they make (the Section 6 Public Duty). The Act also requires the courts, in so far as it is possible to do so, to interpret primary and subordinate legislation so as to give effect to the Convention rights. This provision applies to all laws, whenever enacted, but does not go so far as to give . The Act does allow the higher courts to issue a declaration of incompatibility whereupon it remains for Parliament to decide whether or not to amend or repeal the offending legislation.  The effect of this provision is to preserve the tradition of Parliamentary Sovereignty, whilst at the same time enabling judicial scrutiny of all legislation.  11. Notwithstanding the absence of a f, the HRA is of great constitutional Bill of Rights by any other name.  The HRA is an important part of our constitutional arrangements, protecting people from arbitrary actions of the government, safeguarding an independent judiciary which can hold government to account, and ensuring Parliament is able to pass laws which protect our basic rights and freedoms. This duty imposes both                                                            1 See detailed submission from Child Soldiers International  3  positive and negative duties on public bodies, to refrain from infringing our rights and to take positive steps to realise our rights2.  12. We believe that the strong and effective protections contained in the HRA are now at substantial risk of being diluted. The Coalition government formed after the last election between the Conservative Party (which pledged in its election manifesto to repeal the HRA) and the Liberal Democrat Party (defenders of the Act) sets out within its Coalition Agreement the aim to establish a Commission investigate the creation of a UK Bill of Rights that incorporates and builds on all our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, ensures that these rights continue to be enshrined in UK law, and protects and extend our liberties. It will examine the operation and implementation of these obligations, and consider ways to promote a better understanding of the true scope of these obligations and liberties...3.  13. The Commission on a UK Bill of Rights is carrying out its work during a period when the HRA is under sustained attack by some sections of the UK media which repeatedly misrepresent and misreport judicial decisions made under the Act, especially when these concern marginalised or unpopular groups. Unfortunately, many individuals occupying positions of political leadership in the UK, including the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister himself, have chosen to repeat, often in colourful language, these myths and misconceptions rather than fulfilling their obligations to promote and respect human rights. The Home Secretary recently gave a major speech in which she claimed that a decision to deport someone from the UK had been overturned by the HRA because the individual concerned had a pet cat4. Although the Judicial Office5 issued a strong rebuttal of this claim, she has maintained it and, indeed, appears to have enjoyed the support of the Prime Minister. Similarly, when the European Court of Human Rights recently ruled that the blanket ban on prisoners voting in the UK needed to be reviewed to become compliant with the European Convention on physically ill6.  When the UK Supreme Court made a declaration of incompatibility in relation to the sex offenders register (because offenders had no possibility to apply to be removed from the                                                            2 Using this duty the HRA has benefitted countless individuals and helped the public sector deliver services which are fair, resposociety. of the principles and values of the Human Rights Act has secured human rights for individuals without going to a court of law.  http://www.bihr.org.uk/documents/policy/changing-lives-second-edition The Human Rights Futures project at the London School of Economics (LSE) has produced a briefing outlining landmark rulings under the Human Rights Act, May 2011, http://www2.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/articlesAndTranscripts/2011/KlugLandmarks.pdf  3 The Commission is also charged with providing interim advice to the Government on reforming the European ready provided its advice which can be found here: http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/cbr/index.htm 4 Theresa May, the Home Secretary gave a speech to the Conservative Party conference on 4 October 2011, in which she made this claim. 5  supports the judiciary in upholding the rule of law and in delivering justice impartially, speedily and efficientlyhttp://www.judiciary.gov.uk/training-support/jo-index/jo-index 6 Prime Ministers Questions (PMQs), 3 November 2010,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjzmvvozHuw  4  register)7 8. These are but three examples of the angry and ill-informed rhetoric which we believe is having a corrosive effect on the establishment of a culture of human rights in the UK. 14. We are increasingly worried that these developments in the UK will, if not checked, threaten the coherence and credibility of the post World War II human rights settlement, and the important recognition that human rights are internationally recognised and legally binding 9 he appears to be suggesting that a UK Bill of Rights might diverge from those international norms.  Since securing greater adherence to these international norms is one of the purposes of the Universal Periodic Review, we believe it would be useful to seek clarity as to  15. There is a strongly held view amongst many within the human rights and equalities movements that these developments will undermine rather than further protect human rights.  The Prime Minister suggested that a major purpose of any new Bill of Rights would be to take powers away from the Courts and return them to Parliament: be established to look at a British Bill of Rights, because it is about time we ensured that  10  Were a Bill of Rights to seeking to reduce the accountability of government to the courts. 16. rence to the HRA, focusing instead on the ECHR. The HRA and the ECHR are two different legal instruments and a commitment to the ECHR is not the same as a commitment to the HRA. One particular concern is the failure to recognise the importance of the Section 6 Public Duty contained in the HRA. The value of the Section 6 Public Duty was recognised by UK representatives in the previous Universal Periodic Review. As part of the interactive dialogue in response to questions from Ghana and Peru about mainstreaming a human rights culture, the United  11 BIHR is the leading organisation in the UK equipping public and voluntary organisations with the skills to use human rights. It is our view that the HRA offers essential protection to people in vulnerable situations when in the hands of public bodies, and provides a lens through which public services can be run in a personalised and appropriate manner for individuals. When human rights principles aevidence suggests that it leads to better and fairer decisions which respect the essential dignity of service users. Recent comments from the Prime Minister claiming that, the interpretation                                                            7 http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/feb/16/david-cameron-condemns-court-sex-offenders 8 http://www.channel4.com/news/court-decision-on-sex-offenders-is-offensive-says-cameron` 9 PMQs, House of Commons, 1 December 2010. 10 PMQs, House of Commons, 16 February 2011 11 Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, A/HRC/8/25, Human Rights Council, Eighth session, Agenda item 6.     5  12 are in our view dangerous and inaccurate.   17. We alsGovernmentpublic consultation concerning right to private and family life) of the HRA. The tenor of the consultation misrepresented this right, which as a qualified right is balanced against wider public interest. This is a concerning development. When the UK Government seeks to limit rights, this should be undertaken with due care and caution, and conducted in such a way so as to raise public awareness of human rights rather than fuelling myths and misconceptions.  18. Many civil society organisations are deeply sceptical about the prospects, in the current political climate, for a new Bill of Rights to improve the protection of human rights in the UK. In any event, it is surely nonsense to suggest that human rights protection might be improved by repealing the Human Rights Act. Far better to build on this important starting point and to ensure that any attempt to introduce further legal protection builds on the existing framework. It is vital, therefore, that the UK Government is called upon to guarantee, during the Universal Periodic Review, that any attempt to introduce a Bill of Rights will maintain and build upon the existing HRA, rather than seeking its amendment or repeal.  Refusal to give such a guarantee should be recognised as an indication that there is indeed a significant risk of the human rights framework in the UK being eroded.  Public awareness 19. Despite the paucity of government efforts to inform and educate the UK public about human rights in general and the Human Rights Act in particular, the evidence suggests that human rights are popular and respected within the wider population.  For example, the polling company ComRes conducted an opinion survey on behalf of Liberty, a leading UK human rights organisation, on 4 October 2011. This survey found that 93% of people support the need for laws that protect rights and freedoms in Britain and support for the individual rights was also extremely high, eg 95% believe the right to respect for privacy and family life was either vital or important.13  The same survey found that 91% of people do not remember receiving any information about the HRA from the Government. 20. The failure of successive UK governments to fulfill their obligations to promote widespread understanding of human rights is highly damaging to the furtherance of human rights in the UK and should be urgently addressed in this review. We believe that this lack of human righpromote, through educational programmes and other initiatives, a proper understanding of human rights amongst the public at large. The UK considers itself to be at the forefront of                                                            12 David Cameron speech following the riots, Witney, 15 August 2011, full transcript: http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2011/08/society-fight-work-rights  13 Full details of the survey can be found at http://www.comres.co.uk/poll/541/liberty-human-rights-poll-october-2011.htm   6  human rights standards internationally, and makes regular statements concerning the protection of human rights and the rule of law abroad. We want the UK government to be in a strong position to do this, but its credibility and reputation is at stake.  SECTION 2 21. In this section, which is not intended to be exhaustive, we highlight some emerging issues which warrant examination under the UPR.  Health and social care 22. There have been numerous reports, of which we can only reference a few examples here, providing evidence of failures in our health and social care system to adequately protect the rights of older and disabled people in particular. The Care Quality Commission14, undertook an unannounced inspection of 100 hospitals in England in 2011 to examine whether older .15 It found that 20 out of 100 were non-compliant with the required standards and an additional 35 met the standards but were not fully-compliant and needed to improve. Not being compliant included concerns such as patients not being helped to eat and food being dismissive or disrespectful way.      23. These same issues, regarding inadequate provision of food and drink and lack of attention provided to older people in health services, emerged in the investigations of the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman16. 18% of the overall complaints (nearly 9000 in total) the ombudsman received in the year leading up to this report concerned the care of older people.17  24. There is significant evidence that people with learning disabilities are being wholly inadequately treated within our health and social care provision. In 2009, the Health Service Ombudsman and the Local Government Ombudsman published the result of their joint investigation into six cases which had been identified by Mencap18, in its Death by Indifference report19. This report found that people with learning disabilities were dying unnecessarily due to institutional discrimination and neglect in the NHS. For example one man, Martin Ryan, aged 43, with severe learning difficulties and no speech, was left without                                                            14 The independent regulator of health and social care services in England 15 Care Quality Commission, Dignity and nutrition inspection programme, October 2011,  http://www.cqc.org.uk/public/reports-surveys-and-reviews/themes-inspections/dignity-and-nutrition-older-people  16 This body investigates complaints about government departments in the UK and the National Health Service (NHS) in England, and reports to Parliament. The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman published a Report of the Health Service Ombudsman on ten investigations into NHS care of older people, 2011, http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/care-and-compassion/introduction 17 ibid 18 A UK charity, which is the leading voice of learning disability 19 Mencap, Death by indifference, March 2007, http://www.mencap.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/2008-03/DBIreport.pdf  7  in four of the six cases that the public bodies concerned had failed to live up to human rights principles, especially those of dignity 20  25. In May 2011, the BBC broadcast an investigation by its Panorama programme of systematic abuse of people with learning disability and autism in a privately-run residential care establishment called Winterbourne View21. It shocked the nation and demonstrated not only horrific abuse in this home including staff routinely kicking, taunting, pinning down, and slapping residents, but the failure of responsible agencies to prevent this from happening, for allowing it to continue for so long, and for it taking an undercover media investigation for it to be exposed.   26. The UK accepted the recommendation from the last review care illustrates is the urgent need for the Government to address the rights of older people and disabled people in health and social care services, and improve the culture of care.  Proposals to further restrict Legal Aid 27. Government proposals to further restrict Legal Aid are currently being considered by the UK Parliament.  There is widespread concern that these regressive proposals will put legal advice and representation beyond the reach of many people in the UK and place their rights at risk. The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill sets out measures which would cut the legal aid system in England and Wales to save £350million from the £2.1billion legal aid budget. Over the past 10 years, funding for civil legal aid has decreased by 24% in real terms. The proposals seek to decrease funding for legal aid for housing, education, welfare, and employment. The proposals will see legal aid removed for disabled people seeking welfare advice, families struggling with debt, and in family and immigration cases, meaning people may be prevented from being unified with their family, losing access to their children or unable to seek remedies to protect themselves from domestic violence. Violence against women  28. The government has adopted a national strategy and plan to address violence against women, seeking to locate the issue within the international human rights framework, though with insufficient regard to the domestic framework provided by the HRA22.  However, the UK has not set up a strategic oversight body such as a commission on violence, as recommended during the 2008 UPR. T23, cited in the m progress update was closed by the Government on 31 December 2010. The                                                            20Parliamentary and Health service Ombudsman, Six Lives: The provision of public services to people with learning disabilities, March 2009,  http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/improving-public-service/reports-and-consultations/reports/health/six-lives-the-provision-of-public-services-to-people-with-learning-disabilities/3 21 BBC Panorama's Undercover Care: The Abuse Exposed, BBC One, Tuesday, 31 May 2011 22 against women and domestic violence.   23 The official, independent, advisory body giving the views of women to the UK Government, including on violence against women  8  UK has also not yet signed the European Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence. 29. There is serious concern that the likelihood of sufficient funding being available to properly implement the plan is remote. At the same time funding for the womes sector, and especially those organisations providing frontline support to women survivors of violence is precarious, with a series of ad hoc and insufficient arrangements raising doubts about the sustainability of the sector.  30. Convictions rates for rape remain extremely low by comparison to other crimes of violence. In this context there is alarm at Government proposals relating to anonymity in rape trials, which at one point suggested the government was considering removing the victims presumption of anonymity. Equally there is much concern about a small but growing number of cases in which women have been prosecuted when they have withdrawn allegations or the case has collapsed. One particular issue that needs urgent attention is the support from the state  leaving women to choose between destitution or remaining in an abusive, violent and potentially lethal relationship.    Disability hate crime and the failure to protect right to life  31. The Independent Police Complaints Commission, (IPCC) highlighted a worrying trend in the rbing pattern of avoidable mistakes being repeated 24.  An emerging issue concerns understanding hate crime targeted at disabled people. We wish to draw attention to the case of Fiona Pilkington and her daughter. An inquest into their deaths ended in September 2009. The inquest heard that Ms Pilkington and her neighbours had made 33 calls over a seven-year period asking police for help after suffering repeated and continuing abuse and torment from a gang of youths outside her home. In October 2007, Ms Pilkington drove to a lay-by near Earl Shilton, Leicestershire and set the car alight with her and her disabled daughter inside the vehicle. The IPCC investigation into the death of Ms Pilkington reported in May 2011. Othe police to consider the treatment of this family as hate crime, and 25 32. There were similar findings by the IPCC following the death of David Askew, a 64 year old man with learning difficulties, after ten years of harassment by youths.26 33. The UK has a strong legislative framework for protecting different groups against hate crime, such as on grounds of race, religion and sexual orientation, though it remains an issue of                                                            24 Nick Hardwick, Foreword, Independent Police Complaints Commission, Annual Report and Statement of Accounts 2009/10, p8   25 IPCC publishes Fiona Pilkington investigation report http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/Pages/pr_240511_pilkington.aspx 26 IPCC publishes findings from investigation into GMP contact with David Askew   http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/Pages/pr_210311_gmpaskew.aspx  9  grave concern in all these areas27. The UK is amending the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill to introduce a minimum sentence of 30 years for disability and transgender hate crime murder (currently the standard for other strands). We recommend that the Government establishes a better system for collating data on hate crime, to ensure this issue is addressed in all parts of the country, and that it is  given due priority within all police forces.   Dale farm  34. The events at Dale Farm in which up to 86 Irish Traveller families were evicted with no standards on housing and e28. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination condemned the eviction as disproportionate and expressed serious concerns that it may worsen the already high levels of discrimination and hostility towards Travellers and Gypsies.29 Of gsolution.30 We urge the Human Rights Council to consider recommendations for the UK to ensure adequate provision of culturally appropriate sites are granted to Travellers and Gypsies, to reinsert the duty on local councils to provide sites for Travellers and Gypsies and for the UK government to ensure it complies with its international obligations.     Control Orders 35. future of control orders. The control order scheme introduced by the last Government is a significant breach of the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence, is unsafe and unfair. The new system of Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures will still include electronic tagging and an overnight residence requirement. Although they will make access  will still place restrictions on who controlees can meet, and where they can go (including foreign travel bans). And although they will be limited to two years, it appears likely that they may be renewable, making any such restriction illusory. Under the proposals, the control orders will still be initiated by the Home Secretary and the regime will continue to run outside of the criminal justice system of investigation, arrest, charge and conviction. Overall, these new proposals aim to continue the process of punishment without trial which was the hallmark of the previous regime, and                                                              27 See NGOs Against Racism report to CERD, July 2011 http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/NGOsAgainstRacism_UK79.pdf on homophobic hate crime http://www.stonewall.org.uk/documents/homophobic_hate_crime__final_report.pdf 28 Amnesty International, http://action.amnesty.org.uk/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1194&ea.campaign.id=11724&gclid=COH6mKr7rqwCFYEZ4QodrCB0GQ 29 http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/statements/DaleFarm_Statement.pdf 30 http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/19/dale-farm-evictions-un-negotiation  10  Protest  36. We continue to be very concerned that the right to protest protected under Article 21 (Right of peaceful assembly) of the ICCPR is undermined by a range of measures. Laws which are intended to be used to combat anti-social behaviour, terrorism and serious crime are routinely used against legitimate protesters or disproportionately. Broad anti-terrorism powers of stop and search have been used to harass and stifle peaceful protest. Protest around Parliament has been severely restricted by laws limiting and overly regulating the right to assemble within 1km of the Houses of Parliament. We are also very concerned that intrusive police photography of peaceful protesters is becoming commonplace, using powers under the Terrorism Act which were intended only to be used against those who intend to use photographs for the purpose of terrorism. The practwhereby a large number of protesters are detained within a police cordon, often for several hours, is we believe often a disproportionate response and one which risks trapping the innocent and the vulnerable alongside the guilty and the hostile. This practice may also breach the right to liberty and is currently before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg31.  Education  37. The Ministry of Justice in partnership with the BIHR ran a Human Rights in Schools project from 2006-2009 and as part of this produced a teaching resource for schools, aimed at children aged 11-1432. This was referred to by the UK in the last review33. Funding for this work has now been discontinued and the Ministry of Justice is no longer directly involved in human rights education in schools. This project also produced guidance for secondary schools on developing a whole school approach to human rights, but this guidance has not yet been published, though we are hopeful it will be soon.  38. Stonewall34, commissioned YouGov35 to poll teachers about homophobic bullying in schools in 2008 and found that nine in ten secondary school teachers and four in ten primary school teachers had witnessed homophobic bullying36.   Child poverty 39. alf child poverty by 2010 is unlikely to be met (official figures will be published in 2012). According to the latest available figures, child poverty fell from 3.4                                                            31 http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/media/press/2011/liberty-client-takes-kettling-challenge-to-court-of-huma.php 32 Right Here, Right Now: Teaching Citizenship through Human Rights, Ministry of Justice and British Institute of Human Rights involving Amnesty International and the Department for Children, Schools and Families, Crown copyright 2009  33 Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, A/HRC/8/25, Human Rights Council, Eighth session, Agenda item 6.    34 The leading gay, bisexual and lesbian equality charity 35 An independent policy company 36 Stonewall, Teachers Report, Teachers' perspective on homophobic bullying in Britain's primary and secondary schools (2009)  http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_school/education_for_all/quick_links/education_resources/4003.asp  11  million (26% of all children) in 1998/99 to 2.6 million (20%) in 2009/10 before housing costs37. Child poverty has fallen by 900,000 since 1999  a significant achievement  but much greater focus is required if the UK is to meet its legally binding target, enshrined in the Child Poverty Act (2010), to eliminate child poverty by 202038. Alarmingly, this figure is expected to rise following the budgetary cuts39. The IFS40 projects child poverty will rise by 800,000 by 2020. IFS research found that the budgetary cuts announced in the ith children most41.  We recognize the fall in child poverty is the largest and most sustained since records began in 1961, but remain disappointed that the UK Government has failed to half child poverty by 2010 despite its acceptance of such a recommendation in the UPR process in 2008. We urge the UK to allocate adequate resources to protect children from hardship resulting from its policies and to meet its commitment to eliminate child poverty by 2020.  Equality 40. The Equality Act 2010 has positively raised the level of protection from discrimination for many groups. The Act introduced a new Single Public Sector Equality Duty on public bodies covering age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion and belief, sex, sexual orientation. However, there is concern that the public sector duty may, in practice, be weaker than the previous law because it does not explicitly include procedural requirements such as equality impact assessments.  41. Some sections of the Equality Act have not yet come into force, including the prohibition on age discrimination in services and public functions, which has particularly significant human rights implications for older people using health and social care services. Following the change of government in 2010 the following sections of the Equality Act will not be implemented: dual discrimination, the inclusion of a duty on public bodies to address socio-economic inequalities and mandatory gender pay gap information. We do not believe the voluntary measures being proposed to address the gender pay gap are sufficient.  42. An equality act for Northern Ireland has been planned for several years, but progress to date is limited.   43. The HRA provides a right to non-discrimination (article 14) but only in relation to the enjoyment of the other rights. We strongly recommend the UK adopts a free standing right to equality.  44. Despite having cross-party support when passed in Parliament the Equality Act was subject to a UK government web-based public consultation the Red Tape Challenge on whether                                                            37 Department for Work and Pensions (May 2011) Households below average income: an analysis of the income distribution 1994/5-2009/10, London.  38 ibid 39 Forecasts by the OECD and independent research centres, for instance, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) predict that child poverty rates will rise following the budgetary cuts. 40 Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research centre 41 http://www.endchildpoverty.org.uk/news/news/new-ifs-research-shows-families-and-poorest-hardest-hit-by-coalition-cuts/23/184  12  it, or any of its provisions, should be scrapped or retained42. Some of the provisions of the Equality Act have been part of UK law for over 40 years. Since launching the Red Tape Challenge the Government has stated it is not intending to repeal the Equality Act, but information is not yet available on any changes which may be made to it. We are very concerned that laws and regulations designed to prevent discrimination and promote fairness are being depicted by the UK government as burdensome on business.  In a CERD committee a group of NGOs highlighted that of the over 6000 responses, 96% did not want the Act to be scrapped43.  Disabled people  45. e deficit are having a disproportionate impact on disabled people44. It is estimated that disabled people will lose £9 billion in benefits in the course of this Parliament (2010-2015)45. This report also by not including the much higher everyday costs,46 that disabled people face, just to achieve the same standard of living as a non-disabled person47.   Disability organisations are concerned that proposed changes to disability support will reduce disabled pwill hit disabled people disproportionately hard.48 There are concerns that proposals to remove the mobility component of this allowance from disabled people living in residential homes will confine people to their homes. Overall, the cuts will be highly damaging to disabled people and people with mental health problems, making access to the system extremely difficult and exacerbating existing mental health conditions for many. 46. Local government is facing cuts of 26% to the grant it receives from central government. This is causing huge pressure on the budgets for essential services that disabled people rely on and which guarantee their human rights and dignity. Recent court cases have found that changing eligibility criteria is unlawful, when due regard is not paid to the needs of disabled people. 49                                                             42 The Red Tape Challenge, http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/equalities-act/ 43 Joint submission by UK NGOs Against Racism to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) with regard to , p17. http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/NGOsAgainstRacism_UK79.pdf 44 For detailed information on the situation regarding disabled please refer to the UPR submission from Disability Rights Watch UK  45 Report from think-tank Demos in 2010, funded by leading disability charity, Scope http://www.scope.org.uk/sites/default/files/Counting_the_Cost.pdfRegression around equality act, and weakening of specific duties.  46 ibid 47 The Welfare Reform Bill going through Parliament will replace the Disability Living Allowance which was introduced in recognition of the additional costs faced by disabled people. 48 http://www.scope.org.uk/news/welfare-reform-bill-scope-comment 49 R (JM and NT) v Isle of Wight Council [2011] EWHC 2911 admin  http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/2911.html, R (W) v Birmingham City Council [2011] EWHC 1147 (Admin  13  Race 47.

The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights reviewed the UK in May 2009, expressing concernrejected asylum seekers52; giving asylum seekers access to the labour market; (asylum seekers are currently prohibited from working); and ensuring access to essential services, including the availability of HIV/AIDS treatment. These recommendations were endorsed by the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants in 2010.  49. The UK was criticised for not meeting its own five-year deadline of resolving all the asylum cases.53 The unacceptable delay some asylum seekers have faced is compounded by the concerns of destitution among refused asylum seekers.  50. The detention of asylum seekers and migrants remains a pressing concern, including the inappropriate detention of vulnerable adults, including victims of torture and trafficking.                                                            50 For detailed information on race we recommend reference to the full report http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/NGOsAgainstRacism_UK79.pdf 51 Still Human Still Here submission to UPR, www.stillhuman.org  52 Concluding observations of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 12 June 2009, para 27, http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/429/21/PDF/G0942921.pdf?OpenElement 53  The Home Affairs Committee of the UK Parliament criticised the UK Border Agency for failing to meet its they are unable to contact the applicant, but refugee support agencies report having clients who have been in regular contact and whose cases are still outstanding. It is estimated the number of legacy cases totalled about 450,000 when identified in 2006 in a backlog within the Home Office.

Conclusion 51. We thank the Human Rights Council for providing this opportunity to submit information from UK civil society concerning progress towards human rights in the UK. We hope this submission provides useful context for the 13th session of the Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review.                                                             54 Detention Action UPR submission.

About the Human Rights Consortium  The Human Rights Consortium was established in 2000 and is now a coalition of over 190 non statutory, not for profit and non political party organisations from across Northern Ireland which represents every community and sectoral issue. We campaign together for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, a commitment which was originally made in our peace agreement the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in 1998 but has yet to be implemented.  In addition the Human Rights Consortium works toward embedding a culture of rights across the province through workshops, publications and capacity building with our members to facilitate and encourage human rights engagement.   3. Human Rights Issues relating to Northern Ireland   There are a number of human rights issues outstanding in Northern Ireland but as our remit concerns a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland we will focus on this point. In addition we will raise an issue about general UK wide human rights protection. a) Bill of Rights   Human Rights Consortium- Joint UPR Submission- United Kingdom- 2012  4  1. Northern Ireland is a conflicted and segregated society which continues to deal with the legacy of conflict which directly or indirectly affected the lives of the majority of people in Northern Ireland. Those communities most affected by the so-called Troubles in terms of death and injury remain the most socio-economically disadvantaged. Although we now have a functioning executive and enjoy relative peace  peace is not a done deal here and every day there are rumblings of discontent and dissatisfaction at times resulting in violence.   There are two interlinked issues which the UK government has failed to address despite repeated public and legislative commitments to do so- dealing with the past and the Bill of Rights.  2. political parties, trade unions and civil society in response to socio-economic discrimination and inequality. In 1998, following over three decades of conflict, the Irish and UK government along with Northern Ireland political parties signed the Belfast Good Friday peace agreement in which a firm commitment was finally made for a Bill of Rights.  3. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) was created to give advice to Government on what should be in a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.  They consulted widely with communities and various sections of society however in 2006, due to perceived lack of political engagement in the process, the Bill of Rights Forum was created to enable civil society and politicians to work together to produce advice on a Bill of Rights to the NIHRC, which they did in 1998. The NIHRC in turn considered this advice and produced their own comprehensive advice to the UK government which was presented to the Secretary of State in 2009. The UK government took over nine months to examine the NIHRC advice and issued a consultation document in which they wholesale rejected the Commissions advice and consulted essentially on only two rights- the right to be British or Irish (which we already have in the Good Friday Agreement) and the right to take part in elections (which we already have in the Human Rights Act). The Human Rights Consortium facilitated widespread public and civil society engagement in the consultation with the result that over 36,000 individual and organisational responses were received by the UK government with 95% of these responses rejecting the government proposals and calling for a strong Bill of Rights.  4. Since the consultation ended the UK government have refused to analyse the 36,000 plus responses despite a commitment to do so and have instead stated that there is no cross party support among local political parties in Northern Ireland for a Bill of Rights and that without this support a Bill cannot be progressed. This is a gross misrepresentation of the situation when in fact all Northern Ireland parties have agreed at some stage to a Bill of Rights  the point of disagreement lies in the content and how extensive these rights should be.  5. The Consortium works to facilitate the progress of a Bill of Rights and as part of this carry out regular independent polling to assess the levels of support for a Bill. Annual  Human Rights Consortium- Joint UPR Submission- United Kingdom- 2012  5  polling shows upwards of 80% public support for a Bill and our latest polling (see below) shows that there is no statistical difference between support for a Bill of currently governing Northern Ireland).  Importance of a Bill of Rights by party support  Sinn Fein (95*) 88%  SDLP (106)  86%  DUP (178)  84%  UUP (70*)  83%  Alliance (79*)  81%   6. The Bill of Rights provides an invaluable opportunity to address the human rights abuses of the past and to create a set of shared values on which the people of Northern Ireland can build a stable and peaceful future, one in which the government can be held to proper account. Since 1998 there has been over a decade of debate, discussion, consultation, public polling, and legal advice and yet we are no further to achieving a Bill of Rights. This latest research provides a clear mandate for political parties in Northern Ireland to move forward on the Bill of Rights - a process which must be led and facilitated by the British Government.    The review process may wish to ask the UK government how it intends to honour the  commitments of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and in particular what consideration it has given to the Concluding Observations of various UN treaty mechanism including;  Concluding Observations of the UN Committee on Economic and Social Rights  ly recommends the inclusion of effective protection for economic, social and cultural rights, consistent with the provisions of the Covenant, in   Concluding Observations of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child  its legislation into line with the Convention. To this aim, the State party could take the opportunity given in this regard by the development of a Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland and a British Bill of Rights, and incorporate into them the principles and provisions of the Convention, e.g. by having a special section in these bills devoted to   Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination Ireland. The Committee further regrets that Northern Ireland does not have a Bill of Rights notwithstanding the provisions of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement of 1998 and recommendations from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.... The Committee wishes to remind the State party that the obligation to implement the provisions of the Convention in all parts of its territory is borne by the State party. This makes the State party the duty bearer at the international level in respect of the implementation of the Convention in all parts of its territory notwithstanding the  Human Rights Consortium- Joint UPR Submission- United Kingdom- 2012  6  specific governance arrangements that it may have adopted. In this regard, the Committee recommends that the State party should take immediate steps to ensure that a single equality law and a Bill of Rights are adopted in Northern Ireland or that the Equality Act 2010 is extended to Northern Ireland. (2011, at para 19)  A strong message from the review with regard to the Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland would be helpful in progressing this process.   b) UK wide human rights protection   1. The Human Rights Consortium is concerned not only that the UK Government will continue to renege on its commitment to deliver a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland but also that it may undermine what few rights protections already exist. The current Conservative led Government has been openly hostile toward human rights and in particular European judgements and has established a UK Bill of Rights Commission to advise on a possible UK Bill of Rights which many believe is an exercise intended to regress human rights protections and one which would endanger the Human Rights Act (domestic legislation which incorporates parts of the European Convention). The UK government has ratified a wide range of UN treaties which are not readily enjoyed in Northern Ireland or in the rest of the UK as their content is not disseminated, not incorporated and not embedded here. A UK Bill of Rights provides a possible vehicle for incorporating these commitments into domestic law so that they can be readily accessible and enjoyed by the people of the UK.   A clear message from the reprotect and promote the rights which they are a party to may assist.  The review process may wish to ask the UK government how it intends to incorporate their existing international commitments into domestic law.

43,Justice - JUSTICE,"           Universal Periodic Review: United Kingdom  (May 2012)   JUSTICE Stakeholder Submission     November 2011     For further information contact Angela Patrick, Director of Human Rights Policy email: apatrick@justice.org.uk tel: 020 7329 5100  JUSTICE, 59 Carter Lane, London EC4V 5AQ  tel: 020 7329 5100 fax: 020 7329 5055  email: admin@justice.org.uk  website: www.justice.org.uk      2 Introduction  1. JUSTICE is a UK-based human rights and law reform organisation. Its mission is to advance access to justice, human rights and the rule of law. It is the British section of the International Commission of Jurists.1    a) Pre-charge detention: Treatment of Suspects and Access to Justice2  2. Several recommendations from the last UPR cycle focused on the pre-charge detention of criminal suspects in the UK.  We welcome several positive developments, but we are concerned that this progress may be hampered by new potential threats to the right to liberty and the right to a fair hearing.  3. In the Protection of Freedoms Bill 2010, the Government proposes to reduce the period of pre-charge detention from 28 days to 14 days.3  JUSTICE welcomes this proposal, having criticised the previous time-frame as disproportionate and incompatible with the right to liberty.  Unfortunately, the Government plans to introduce emergency legislation designed to extend the period of detention temporarily if circumstances demand it (an example which has been given poses several simultaneous and serious terrorist attacks on London).4  We consider that the prospect of a debate which examines the necessity for continuing to detain a suspect or group of suspects at a highly sensitive time, when individuals are likely to be in custody, poses a serious risk to the right to a fair trial.  Detention for up to 28 days was rarely used in practice and we see no need for the Government to put down a marker that Parliament might be enabled to extend pre-charge detention at a time of national crisis.  Emergency legislation of this kind generally makes bad law; its use in the circumstances proposed could entirely undermine the right to due process and restrict our ability to bring those accused of the most serious criminal offences to justice.    4. In Cadder v HM Advocate, the UK Supreme Court held that people in Scotland must have access to legal advice while detained at a police station.  Until this decision, there had been no such right in domestic law.  The Scottish authorities had argued that since a person could only be detained for a limited time (around 6 hours); together with other safeguards, this was adequate to protect the individual right to a fair hearing.   The Supreme Court disagreed.5  This important decision has led to significant changes in Scots criminal procedure.  Unfortunately, these provide far greater room for exception than in England and Wales, and could lead to an individual being denied access to legal advice at the discretion of individual officers and does not require representation at interview.  Advice could be limited to advice over the telephone.6  Since this development, the UK Government has proposed that it should have the power to enable it to limit access to legal advice in police stations in England and Wales to telephone advice.7  We are concerned that these developments represent a significant shift away from the right of detained persons to effective legal advice and undermine the right to liberty and the right to a fair trial guaranteed by the ICCPR.8    b) Counter-terrorism measures, review and international human rights standards9  5. counter-terrorism legislation and policy in the UK and its compatibility with international human rights standards.  We welcomed the recommendations in the UPR on the need for the UK to review existing legislation and remedy any incompatibilities.  6. ision to conduct a wholesale review of its counter-terrorism law and policy; its outcome has been disappointing. 10  The Government proposes to remove its restrictive powers to impose control orders on terrorist suspects, but Prevention 11   The Protection of Freedoms Bill proposes to remove the exceptional power to stop and search individuals without reasonable suspicion, but an alternative power is proposed in its place without adequate safeguards for legal certainty and the right to respect for privacy.12    7. We are concerned that criminal offences created as part of the previous Governmen-terrorism strategy and criticised for their broad breadth and chilling effects on the right to freedom of expression, remain in force with no plans for review.13       8. No progress has been made to improve the likelihood of effective prosecution in terrorism cases.   The fruits of intercepted communications remain inadmissible in court proceedings.  In 2009, during the trial of three terrorist suspects accused of plotting to attack transatlantic aircraft, e-mails between    3 the UK and Pakistan, intercepted by US authorities in California, formed part of the evidence.  This highlights the absurdity that similar evidence intercepted by UK intelligence services would be excluded from evidence.14   9. The definition of terrorism in the UK remains extraordinarily broad and out of step with the language of international law.15    10. There is work yet to be done in the UK to ensure that our counter-terrorism law and policy operates to keep us safe while respecting fundamental human rights standards.  c) Jurisdiction and extent of human rights obligations16  11. A number of recommendations focus on the alleged involvement or complicity of UK troops and intelligence services in torture and ill-treatment of detainees overseas.  In its mid-term review of compliance with the UPR recommendations, the Government expressed its view that all UK Armed the treatment of detainees.  The Government has continued to resist the extraterritorial application of international and regional standards to the activities of troops overseas.  We are concerned that this resistance has led, demonstrably, to failures in the ability of the UK to meet the standards required by international human rights law and the laws of war, when operating overseas.  Several developments support the need for a wholesale review of UK Armed Forces training materials and the operation of legal advice on human rights standards in theatre:     In 2011, the European Court of Human Rights confirmed that the standards in the European Convention on Human Rights apply to people in the custody of UK Armed Forces overseas.17   A major public inquiry into the death of Baha Mousa, an Iraqi man who died after detention by UK Armed Forces in 2003, made significant criticisms of his treatment at the hands of individual troops; the training, guidance and advice given to individual troops and groups within the UK Armed Forces.18  After a successful judicial review of revised guidance on the treatment of detainees, this new guidance required further revision in order to meet the obligations of the UK to protect against unlawful torture and ill-treatment under Article 3 ECHR.19  12. These developments followed a heightened number of allegations of complicity of UK Armed Forces and Intelligence Services in torture and ill-treatment, including allegations in relation to the operation of UK troops in Iraq, involvement in relation to detention of individuals in Pakistan and Egypt and allegations in connection with the treatment of Binyam Mohammed, who was detained in Pakistan and then at Guantanamo Bay.20  intention to hold a public inquiry to investigate these allegations after the conclusion of the necessary criminal investigations had been completed.21  13. In November 2011, speaking to accusations of complicity in torture, ill-treatment and rendition, the the very making of these allegations undermined Britain's standing in the world as a country that upholds steps  in the announced public inquiry on the treatment of detainees (the Gibson inquiry)22 and the introduction of proposals to enable litigation on allegations of ill-treatment to proceed under special Closed Material Procedures23  in order to ensure a full inquiry into existing allegations and proper investigation into similar claims in the future.24  14. Unfortunately, the terms of reference and procedure adopted by the Gibson inquiry undermine its capability to undertake an effective and independent review.  The Government (in the form of the Cabinet Secretary) will have ultimate control of disclosure of material and a significant part of the inquiry will be conducted behind closed doors and with no avenue for full public scrutiny of the allegations concerned.  In light of its failings, both the detainees and a number of significant civil society organisations have decided to boycott this inquiry.25  In these circumstances, it is inconceivable that the Government can continue to rely on this mechanism to discharge its international obligations to conduct an effective inquiry into the alleged torture and mistreatment of individual detainees.26     15. In its Justice and Security Green Paper, the Government proposes to allow the executive to certify when certain information relevant to civil litigation must be considered by the court under Closed    4 Material Procedures (when the material is not revealed to the claimant or the public).  The Government proposes to introduce mechanisms which would ensure that litigation brought by the Guantanamo detainees would have taken place behind closed doors, with the claimants unable to see information on which the Government sought to rely.   The breadth of the proposals is extremely wide and proposes to grant a broad discretion to the executive to determine when these measures will be appropriate.     16. The Government proposes to change the law to ensure that when the UK holds certain information (including information which may provide evidence of torture or treatment in violation of the UN Convention against Torture) existing procedural measures in domestic law cannot be used to force the Government to reveal that information, if the Government deems national security is at risk.27    17. We do not consider that the sweeping measures proposed by the Government are justified.  They represent a fundamental in-road into the principle of open justice enshrined in domestic common law intelligence services rather than striking them out.  Unfortunately, this ignores the implications of any hearing based on evidence seen only by one side and unchallenged by the other.  As Lord Kerr said in the Supreme Court decision in Al-Rawi: w28     18. The consultation on these proposals closed in January 2012 and legislation is expected later in 2012.  We consider that the proposals to extend the use of Closed Material Procedures in the UK capacity to meet its international obligations in a manner which is transparent, accountable and fair.      d) Freedom of expression, policing and protest29  19. The last UPR review took place in 2008, before the death of Ian Tomlinson during the policing of the G20 protests in the City of London in 2009.30   In the aftermath of this case, and wider criticism of policing techniques  techniques, significant public attention was placed on the importance of police management of public demonstrations in order to facilitate the right to protest, while protecting individuals from violence and officers.31     20. The proportionality of public order policing in the UK continues to cause concern as public demonstrations rise in the face of increasing austerity measures.  Litigation continues on the propriety of measures to contain protesters and the proportionality of arrests and sentences associated with offences in connection with different demonstrations.  The European Court of during 2012.32    21. During recent weeks, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) in London appears to have adopted a pre-emptive approach to policing of mass demonstrations which far from facilitating the individual techniques in question have included writing to individuals who had previously been arrested for disorder before a planned demonstration to warn them against coming to the protest and participating in disorder, and issuing a press statement to announce that baton rounds (or rubber 33  By intimating that the event is likely to become violent, and require a violent response, both of these techniques represent a departure from previous practice in the UK and appear designed to have a chilling effect on people who intend to exercise the right to protest.  While the police have a clear responsibility to protect individuals from violence and disorder and to police associated offences, marking protest activity as inherently violent does little to facilitate peaceful protest.    22. The MPS was openly criticised in the press in connection with alleged failures associated with mass rioting in London in summer 2011.  We are concerned to ensure that, in developing their approach to the policing of protest, proportionality is the key starting point for any force in the UK.  Conflating the extremely violent scenes seen during the mass disorder which took place during the London riots with other subsequent planned or unplanned demonstrations is unhelpful.       5  23. In their response to the last UPR, the then Government made clear its intention to relax the existing law limiting the right to protest within 1km of the Houses of Parliament.  The Police and Social Responsibility Act 2011 removes this restriction, but introduces new limitations and associated offences connected with protest in the area immediately opposite Parliament.  These include restrictions on the use of sleeping materials (including blankets, sleeping bags and tents), loudhailers and other noise amplification equipment.34  We have expressed our concern that these restrictions appear overly broad and should not be used disproportionately to discourage the exercise of free expression in this area of outstanding importance for democracy in the United Kingdom.35    e) The bigger picture:  A Bill of Rights for the UK?36  24. The UK is currently engaged in a highly controversial debate about the proper approach to the protection of human rights domestically.  This debate has involved high-level criticism of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the existing means by which domestic rights are executed and justiciable in the UK).  As part of the current coalition agreement for Government, a Commission on a Bill of Rights for the UK has been established to investigate the creation of a UK Bill of Rights that incorporates and builds on all our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, ensures that these rights continue to be enshrined in UK law, and protects and extend our liberties37  Concurrently, the UK holds the Chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers at the Council of Europe.  One of the with a view to reinstating the primary responsibility of the states to determine the scope of domestic rights protection.    25. We are not persuaded that there is any evidence base for change, or that the current debate about a Bill of Rights for the UK is necessary.  We are concerned that the politicised nature of this debate In the long-term, we are concerned that any change to our existing constitutional arrangements which reduces the level of substantive or procedural protection offered by the Human Rights Act 1998 will damage the ability of the UK to meet its obligations both under the European Convention on Human Rights and the equivalent guarantees in the ICCPR and other instruments.38  f) The bigger picture: Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill  26. The Government proposes to reduce the circumstances when individuals will be able to secure legal aid to fund legal advice, assistance and representation.39    We are concerned that these proposals will have a significant impact on access to justice. In the long-term, reducing the ability of individuals without independent resources to challenge their treatment will damage the protection of fundamental rights in practice, without effective scrutiny.  For example, if individuals are unable to seek professional advice on their housing disputes, we are concerned that this may have an unseen impact on the quality of housing and the associated right to adequate housing in the UK.40  We consider that the UK Government has not yet provided an appropriate analysis of the decision to restrict access to legal aid significantly, or shown how the UK will continue to monitor the effective implementation of fundamental rights in the absence of publicly funded legal challenges to public decision-making.    JUSTICE November 2011    6                                                  1 In accordance with Decision 17/119 and the guidance of the OHCHR, we limit our comments to a few key areas, principally focusing on the recommendations in A/HRC/8/25/Add.1.  The numbers allocated to the recommendations in this submission correspond to that document.  This response should not be treated as a h its international human rights obligations. 2 Recommendation 3: Enshrine the right of access of detainees to a lawyer immediately after detention, and not after 48 hours; Recommendation 15: Strengthen guarantees for detained persons, and not extend, but shorten the length of time of pre-trial detentions. 3 Clauses 57 - 58 4 The Government has published draft legislation for consultation.  These two draft Bills, the Detention of Terrorism Suspects (Temporary Extensions) Bills are, in effect, draft legislation to be introduced in Parliament in an emergency authorising the temporary extension of the period to 28 days.  These draft Bills We also doubt whether it has been demonstrated, by evidence, that it is necessary to make provision now for a contingency power to extend the period of pre-charge detention beyond 14 days in the event of some future emergency. We note that the Joint Committee on the draft bills considered that such a power would only be required in ""truly exceptional circumstances"". It is always possible to imagine such extreme scenarios but an evidence-based approach to law-making requires rigour in assessing the likelihood of such exceptional circumstances arising. It is a paradox of democratic accountability that elected Governments are unlikely to risk saying overtly that the threat from terrorism has diminished. Responsible Parliaments, however, must take a view, on the information available, as to whether emergency powers are really necessary. In our view, on the evidence we have seen, the case for legislating now to provide an emergency power to increase the period of pre-charge detention beyond 14 days has not been made out.   See Eighteenth Report of Session 2010-12, The Protection of Freedoms Bill, HC 195/HC 1490, para 130.   5 [2010] UKSC 43 6 Criminal Procedure (Legal Assistance, Detention and Appeals)(Scotland) Act 2010. 7 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, Clause 12.  Although the Government has indicated that it does not intend to use this power, it has resisted all attempts by Parliamentarians to limit its scope or remove it from the Bill.  See for example, Law Society Gazette, Government will not remove police station advice, 4 July 2011. 8 Articles 9, 10, 14. 9 Recommendation 4: Introduce strict time limits on pre-charge detention of those suspected of terrorism, and provide information about so-.  Recommendation 8: Continue to review all counter-terrorism legislation and ensure that it complies with the highest human rights standards. 10 The Government announced the outcome of its review of counter-terrorism and security powers in January 2011.  Together with the outcome of the review, the Government published an independent report by Lord MacDonald of River Glaven QC, who had been asked to comment on the review and its outcome. 11  12 Protection of Freedoms Bill, Clauses 59  63.  .    7                                                                                                                                                             13 These include the offence of glorification of terrorism (Sections 1, 2, 21, Terrorism Act 2006).  When the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights asked the Government whether it intended to repeal this offence as part of its counter-terrorism review or in the Protection of Freedoms Bill, no positive response was forthcoming.  See  Eighteenth Report of Session 2010-12, The Protection of Freedoms Bill, HC 195/HC 1490, pages 86  89.  14 inadequacies of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and calls for numerous reforms, including the lifting of the ban on intercept as evidence.  See JUSTICE, Freedom from suspicion:  Surveillance Reform for a Digital Age, November 2011. 15 The UK parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has concluded that the breadth of the definition of terrorism in Section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000 gives rise to a high risk that the relevant speech offences connected with terrorism are in breach of the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 ECHR (and Article 19 ECHR).  See  See  Eighteenth Report of Session 2010-12, The Protection of Freedoms Bill, HC 195/HC 1490, pages 86  89. 16 Recommendation 16: Consider that any person detained by its armed forces is under its jurisdiction and respect its obligations concerning the human rights of such individuals.  Recommendation 17: Accept the full and unrestricted implementation of UNCAT and the ICCPR in territories under its control. Recommendation 22: Elaborate specific policies and programmes aimed at ensuring that its applicable human rights obligations are not violated in situations of armed conflict.   17 See Al Skeini v United Kingdom, App No 55721/07 and Al Jedda v United Kingdom, App No 27021/08, judgment dated 7 July 2011.   The first case decided by the Court, Al Skeini v United Kingdom, concerned the killing of six Iraqi civilians by British soldiers in southern Iraq, including the brutal death of Baha Mousa during his detention at a UK army base. In 2007, the House of Lords ruled that the Human Rights Act did not the UK government had a duty to conduct an effective investigation into the deaths of all the civilians killed by British soldiers, whether or not they were within the confines of a UK military base. It based its decision on the fact that the UK had assumed responsibility for the maintenance of security in Southern Iraq and were ns. The second case, , involved the indefinite detention of a dual British/Iraqi citizen in a Basra facility run by British forces. In 2007, the House of Lords ruled unanimously that the detention was lawful because the UK government had been authorised by UN Security Council resolution 1546. However, the Grand Chamber today held that the Security Council resolution did Convention on Human Rights. 18 The Gage Inquiry into the death of Baha Mousa reported on 8 September 2011.  Copies of the Inquiry report and its recommendations are available, here: http://www.bahamousainquiry.org/index.htm.

44,JWY - JUST West Yorkshire,"JUST West Yorkshire UN Human Rights  Universal Periodic Review JUST West Yorkshire is a racial justice, civil liberties and human rights organisation that has been working in West Yorkshire, England since 2003. Human rights are important to us because they provide a legal framework that ensures that everyone has a right to live their life in dignity. Critically the Human Rights Act has proven to be a powerful tool that organisations have been able to use to hold public services and the UK government to account, especially at a time when the austerity budget and the diminution of civil liberties are eroding our fundamental rights as humans and citizens.  a Bill of Rights will reduce the protections enshrined in UK legislation its citizens. These measures are part of a larger pattern in which legislation, which accords citizens rights such as the Equality Act are being undermined.   In the face of continued evidence of human rights abuse by the UK government (see below) it is critical that the Act is retained in its present form, as a universal benchmark of our performance against other signatories. Given the propensity of governments to accrue power to themselves it is our view that the HRA offers the best protection for individuals as it is free from executive interference and the vagaries of political ideology.   We are extremely concerned that the call to replace the Human Rights Act with a Bill of Rights will undermine the legal protection of human rights in the UK, and it will set a dangerous precedent internationally by legitimising attempts by despotic regime to opt-Francesca Klug OBE stated in The Guardian: We would be the first democracy in the world to introduce a bill of rights on the back of scrapping one already on the statute book. The UK would sit alongside Belarus as virtually the only country in Europe not to have incorporated the ECHR  would not necessarily replace the existing Human Rights Act but would recalibrate the rights and responsibilities for the UK begs the question why the HRA should be tampered with at all. If the idea is to enhance individual rights then our view is that this should constitute a framework that is an adjunct to the HRA. The Human Rights Act enshrines the notion of individual rights as indivisible and absolute. The UK Bill of Rights however co-locates the individual rights with the notion of individual responsibility, and in so doing gives politicians the power to define responsibilities in a way that legitimises the diminution of individual rights.  The denigration of the Act by some sections of the media and the PM and the Home ith a real danger that the Bill of Rights  will create a hierarchy of rights in which some humans i.e. UK citizens are accorded superior rights over non-citizens. This would mean less protection for the vulnerable against injustice.    The xenophobic intenthat British people can use in British courts.people unlike the universal scope of the HRA. Cast in a rhetoric that has clear echoes of to appease the gallery of tabloid opinion, whom political parties of all hues depend on to deliver electoral victory.   We are also concerned that the proposal for a Bill of Rights is politically motivated in response to growing pressure from within the Tory party and its rank and file for the party to distance itself from Europe. We consider the warning from the president of the European Court to be apposite in this context i.e. he believes that the Conservative proposal for a Bill of Rights would create a complicated legal situation and threaten the protection currently offered by European human rights law if UK judges had exclusive oversight over its implementation.  There is also clear evidence that the Bill of Rights will be used as an immigration and state security instrument rather than as a framework enshrining rights per se. This is evident in article that Cameron wrote in the Sunday Times. e Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights that will enable ministers to act within the law to protect our society. If M15 tells the home secretary should be free to balance the rights of the suspect with the rights of   We believe that there are clear safeguards within current immigration, criminal justice and anti-terror legislation to safeguard national security.   We are also extremely concerned that the safeguards enshrined under the present HRA upholding the rights of every individual to freedom from torture, inhumane and degrading treatment, will be compromised under the proposals for a domestic Bill of Rights, as it will provide no get out clause from the absolute prohibition on torture.  We are concerned that the 9 people comprising the Bill of Rights Commission of mostly Queen's Counsel are not all human rights experts.  We are concerned that a number of the members on the Commission have made clear that they want to reduce the essential protections this legislation currently provides. We believe this represents a conflict of interest and should be subjected to a review.  JUST believes that the UK government is involved in on-going human rights abuses by the UK on the basis of the following evidence:  1. In 2005 the Independent newspaper published an article Britain in the dock for   The article described Britain as having one of the worst human rights records in Europe.  The allegations concerned violations of the rights of mental health patients to the failure to protect children from unlawful corporal punishment in  the home. The article reported that of the 47 signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights, Britain had 107 guilty judgments - the sixth highest number - issued by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  2. The in the pursuit of the principles. Suspected terrorists have been placed under indefinite house arrest in the form of , without trial and without charge, sometimes for years at a time.  3. A report by Amnesty International in 2010 criticised over use of control orders against terror and it condemned the UK government for taking part in so-called diplomatic assurance deals whereby it extradited people to countries such as Algeria or Jordan where they were likely to face torture.  4. On 6th October 2011 the Guardian reported that Sami al-Saadi (a Libyan dissident) had issued legal action against the British government for the years of torture he suffered as result of British involvement in his rendition to one of GaddWhitehall officials told the Guardian the renditions were the result of ""ministerially authorised government policy"". The case currently relies upon a number of documents that Human Rights Watch, the New York-based NGO, found last month in the abandoned office of Gaddafi's former intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa. Among them is a fax the CIA sent to Koussa in March 2004, which shows that the agency was eager to join in the Saadi rendition operation after learning that MI6 and Gaddafi's government were about to embark upon it. Saadi's wife and children were released after two months of being subjected to what he describes as ""psychological torture"".  Saadi was held for six years and says he was repeatedly beaten, subjected to electric shocks and threatened with death. According to his claim against the British government, he was interrogated about Libyans living in the UK, shown photographs of a number of them, and on one occasion questioned by two British intelligence officers while one of his Libyan interrogators was present. 5. Saadi is not the only Libyan dissident to have found himself in one of Gaddafi's jails as a result of MI6's actions. On 5th September 2011, the Daily Mail Online reported that, secret files and letters found in Libya appeared to show that British Intelligence services provided information which led to the 'rendition' of a Libyan dissident, Abdel Hakim Belhadj.  The letter in question appears to take le: ""I congratulate you on the safe arrival of Abu 'Abd Allah Sadiq,"" it said. ""This was the least we could do for you and Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years. Belhaj claims he was hung from a wall and kept me in an isolation cell In addition to the above concerns there are 5 other key areas of concerns JUST wishes members of the periodic review to take into consideration:  1.  Failure to Protect the Legal Aid system   Government cuts in Legal Aid will remove help for the most poor and vulnerable people thereby denying fundamental access to justice and a fair trial.  This will impact on Article 6  Right to a Fair Trial. According to , legal aid cuts have the potential to impact a greater proportion of women, Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic people, and ill or disabled people. For example, of the 135,000 people per year who will no longer get legal aid to help with welfare benefits issues, 58% will be ill or disabled, compared with the 19% of the population as a whole. This is justified, the Government  namely, saving money as part of its deficit reduction programme. It is our view that the rights intention to sacrifice human rights to achieve its economic policy aims sets a dangerous precedent. 2.  Detention of Mental Health patients in Police custody. Recent guidance from the Department of Health (DH, 2008) made changes to the use of Section 136 when Section 44 of the new Mental Health Act 2007 came into effect on 30 April 2008.  The new legislation allows a person to be taken from one place of safety to one or more different places of safety during the 72-hour maximum period. They may be taken between places of safety by a police officer, an approved social worker (until approved social workers are replaced in this role by approved mental health professionals) or someone authorised by either of them. The guidance also states that police stations  An estimated 11,000 people are detained in police stations as places of safety each year. Use of police custody as a place of safety should only be used as a last resort. Up to 15% of incidents with which the police deal with are thought to have some kind of mental health dimension. A large percentage of people suffering from mental health issues are detained in police cells for considerable periods of time and some cases have documented up to 20 hours in detention before appropriate help is provided.  This breaches Article 8. Many police forces say they have no alternative to using police stations as places of safety due to the absence of appropriate facilities within  should be a hospital rather than a police station yet only 6,400 people are detained in this way in hospitals annually. The Department of Health has expressed concerns that holding a person with a severe mental illness in a police cell for an assessment is entirely inappropriate and could put the patient at risk.  We believe that this represents a serious breach of the human rights of a vulnerable group which the government has not addressed to date.  3. Holding public authorities accountable for unlawful surveillance and false arrests A number of concerns have arisen regarding the unlawful behaviour by the police service and local authorities in the purported exercise of their statutory functions which impact directly on Human Rights legislation.  It has also been reported that police forces are using £13,000 spy drones to tackle anti-social behaviour which appears to be an extreme, disproportionate and intrusive method.  CASE A  A 46 year old lady employed as Community Development Officer in a school for 18 years with an excellent work record was subjected to a prolonged period of surveillance over several weeks by her employer (a local authority) whilst she was on sick leave.  When the surveillance form was scrutinised it transpired that it had been improperly authorised as the grounds to conduct the surveillance had not been met.  The form had been merely rubber stamped without any consideration.  The employee took legal action for breach of Article 8  Right to Respect For Private and Family Life.  Her compensation for breaches involving Human Rights.  She was advised to issue a claim for negligence.  The employee succeeded in her claim and the matter was settled out of court.  No action was taken against the local authority for breaching the Human Rights Act and wasting thousands of pounds on weeks of unlawful surveillance.    CASE B A middle aged was repeatedly harassed on 4 separate occasions by the police to provide a statement over a period of 9 months.  As she refused to do so the police falsely arrested her to put undue pressure on her thereby breaching Article 5 and 8.  No action was ever taken against the individual officers.  A claim has been issued against the relevant police force. Despite clear breaches by the police, there is little evidence that complaints to the Independent Police Complaints Commission are guided exclusively within the ambit of criminal law rather than the human rights framework. This represents an on-going omission by public bodies in the UK who view the human rights as a bolt-on rather than integral to the UK legislative framework.  4.  965% increase in racially motivated crimes  On 29.06.2009 it was reported that the number of racially or religiously-motivated crimes being reported to West Yorkshire Police had risen 12 times faster than in other parts of the country. Government figures show 2,493 crimes were reported in 2007/08 across the county, compared with 234 in 1999/2000  a rise of 965 per cent. Nationally there has been a 82 per cent increase in that period from 21,750 to 39,643. A report by the Minority Rights Group International (MRG) says that Muslims in particular have been increasingly targeted by authorities in Europe and the US as part of counter-terrorism measures, and notes the rising trend in Islamophobia across Europe.  m population are increasingly being demonised and criminalised by the UK legal framework. We believe this represents a breach of their human rights.  5.  Protecting BME police officers from discrimination in the workplace. The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry 10 Years On published in February 2009 claimed that at the end of 2008, almost half of the 43 forces in England and Wales had not reached the employment target for black and minority ethnic officers set by home secretary Jack Straw almost 10 years earlier. The review is also critical of the police's ability to retain black and ethnic minority staff. ""Research examining why officers left the service has indicated that those from black and minority ethnic groups are more likely to have been dismissed or required to  resign compared with their white counterparts (8.5% and 1.7% respectively) or to have left following voluntary resignation (46.6% of leavers from black and minority ethnic backgrounds and 25.9% of all leavers from white backgrounds.)"" The differential treatment of ethnic minority communities by public bodes breaches the Human Rights Act-white citizens and the UK government should be subject to censure.  CONCLUSION  In the UK, we have long professed our commitment to upholding the fundamental liberties of all people. In September 2011 a Liberty/ComRes poll showed mass support (93%) for a law that protects rights and freedoms in Britain. 96% of respondents believed the right to a fair trial is vital or important, 90% believed the right not to be tortured or degraded is vital or important and 95% believed that respect for privacy and family life is vital or important. Yet less than a tenth of respondents (9%) remember ever having received or seen information from the Government explaining the Human Rights Act.  Equally, the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is the most important instrument of international law to emanate from the Council of Europe. Both the Council and the Convention itself were developments in reaction to the past horrific experiences of the Second World War. Britain is intrinsically interwoven into the fabric of Europe, historically, diplomatically and economically and risks undermining and damaging the contribution of many countries, and most cultures, to the human rights values universally recognised throughout the world today if it ignores and turns its back on the international human rights treaties which virtually every modern bill of rights is based on. A large number of key civil liberties and human rights organisations have voiced their concerns collectively regarding the proposed UK Bill of Rights.  We must consider that no country anywhere has proposed to withdraw the human rights treaty from its legal framework so that it can introduce a Bill of Rights.  We consider the Bill of Rights to be a retrogressive step and call on all politicians across the political spectrum to uphold the current Human Rights Act.   Submitted by JUST West Yorkshire.

45,Kalayaan - Kalayaan,"  Jenny Moss, Community Advocate   jenny@kalayaan.org.uk 0207 243 2942   Kalayaan submission to the Universal Periodic Review October 2011   Submitting organisation 1. Kalayaan was established in 1987.  It is a charity that gives direct advice and practical support to migrant domestic workers, including immigration and employment rights advice and assistance retrieving identification documents from employers.  Kalayaan campaigns with migrant domestic migrant domestic workers in the UK.1   Executive Summary 2. This submission discusses migrant domestic workers in the UK.  Migrant domestic workers are particularly vulnerable to violations of their human rights.  The UK currently has a visa system that offers some protection to migrant domestic workers but this is under threat.  This submission argues that the current protections must be maintained, that the UK should improve the system and extend the safeguards to cover domestic workers in the employ of diplomats.  Introduction to migrant domestic workers in the UK 3. Migrant domestic workers have been recognised as vulnerable to serious violations of their rights by a number of United Nations (UN) and regional human rights bodies including the International Labour Organisation, the UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary forms of Slavery and the Council of Europe.  Violations include of the right to be free from slavery, from inhuman and degrading treatment and the right to effective remedy.  4. The vulnerability of migrant domestic workers to violations of their rights stems from their isolation in the private house in an under-regulated working environment.  They are dependent on their employer for their work, accommodation and immigration status as well as for information about their rights in the UK.  They are further isolated by their lack of English language skills.  5. Approximately 15,000 individuals private household each year.  In a written answer to parliament on 13 September 2010 the Immigration Minister stated that 14,892 visas were issued in 2009.2  The figure for 2010 is 15,350.3  6. Approximately 350 migrant domestic worker register with Kalayaan each year, 85% are female.  Of the 332 who registered in 2010, 15 approached Kalayaan as they had become homeless having fled an employer, 45 had no passport or identity documents at that time.                                                             1 Kalayaan documents were accepted by the UK in a 1999 regularisation process for migrant domestic workers.  Kalayaan sits on the UKBA chaired inter-departmental steering group on migrant domestic workers. 2 This was later reported by the UKBA as 10,100 visas in the UK Border Agency consultation on employment-related settlement, Tier 5 and overseas domestic workers. http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/consultations/employment-related-settlement/employment-related-consultation?view=Binary  3 ibid    Jenny Moss, Community Advocate   jenny@kalayaan.org.uk 0207 243 2942   7. Migrant domestic workers who registered with Kalayaan in 2010 reported that their passports had been withheld by employers (65%), they had not been allowed out of the house unaccompanied (60%), had been abused psychologically (54%), physically (18%) and sexually (3%).  Many reported having to ing 16 hours a day or more (48%) and receiving a salary far lower than the national minimum wage; 56% received under £50 per week.  8. Trafficking for domestic servitude is a problem in the UK; 201 referrals of adult victims trafficked for domestic servitude were made to the National Referral Mechanism in its first 24 months.4  9. Domestic workers working with diplomats report similar levels of abuse to those in private households and are found by Kalayaan to be 20 times more likely to have been trafficked.  Relative rates of 3.8% trafficked persons on the diplomatic domestic worker route compared to 0.2% on the private household route.5  Kalayaan believes this difference is due to the fact that the diplomatic domestic worker route does not provide the right to change employer.  Legislative and Policy framework 10. ic workers to abuse and exploitation.  Domestic workers cannot apply to enter the UK independently.  The employer wishing to bring them to the UK must evidence that they have been employing the domestic worker for at least twelve months.  However the visa is an independent status for domestic workers, which gives them the right to change employer (though not employment sector); recognises them as workers in the UK protected by employment legislation; and allows them to renew their visa (if in full time work).  After five years continuous residence migrant domestic workers become eligible for settlement.   11. Migrant domestic workers who enter the UK to work in a diplomatimmigration category.  The most notable difference being that they are not able to change employer outside of the specific mission with whom their employer is posted.  In 2008 the route on which diplomatic domestic workers entered the UK was subsumed into the larger category of It is therefore no longer possible to identify how many diplomatic domestic workers enter the UK.  Diplomatic domestic workers retained some rights others on Tier 5 International Agreement do not have, notably the right to renew their visa and to apply for settlement.  12. The UK ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action against trafficking in 2008.  The  (NRM) was introduced to provide identification and support to victims of trafficking.  This includes a 45 day stay on removal proceedings and access to safe accommodation.                                                             4 Letter from immigration minister Damian Green to Baroness Cox dated 03 October 2011. 5 Lalani, M.  Ending the abuse: Policies that work to protect migrant domestic workers.  Kalayaan May 2011. http://www.kalayaan.org.uk/documents/Kalayaan%20Report%20final.pdf     Jenny Moss, Community Advocate   jenny@kalayaan.org.uk 0207 243 2942   It should also include access to legal advice although Kalayaan has found that in practice this is difficult because of a lack of legal aid capacity.  13.  The Asylum and Immigration Act 2004 criminalises trafficking for forced labour, including domestic servitude in the UK.  There has not yet been a successful prosecution for trafficking an adult into domestic servitude. Section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 provided a stand-alone offence of holding someone in forced labour or servitude.  There has been one successful prosecution since the offence came into force.6  Good practices 14. Kalayaan considers that the UK visa for domestic workers is best practice at preventing abuse and exploitation, though it should be improved and extended (see below).  There has been good cooperation between the UK Government and Kalayaan.  In 2008 an inter-departmental Government steering group was established, with representation from Kalayaan and Unite the Union.  We do not feel this for the visa.  Major concerns 15. Kalayaan have major concerns with regards to promoting and protecting the human rights of domestic workers, particularly because the UK Government does not acknowledge there is an issue to address.  There is no mention of migrant domestic workers in response to the committee for CEDAW7 or in its current action plan on trafficking.8  Our main concerns are that Government proposals threaten the safeguards provided by the visa, that whilst the visa is recognised as good practice and has dramatically improved the situation for domestic workers the system must be improved to further prevent rights violations, and finally that the system of safeguards needs to be extended to diplomatic domestic workers.  Concern 1: Safeguards under threat 16. The UK Government, has, as part of its drive to reduce net migration proposed to either remove the domestic worker visa or alter it so that there is no right to change employer; no recognition as a worker protected by employment law; no right to renew the visa; and no eligibility for settlement or to bring dependents to the UK.  Kalayaan is particularly concerned about removing the right to change employer as there is strong evidence that this provision has dramatically reduced incidence of abuse and exploitation.  In 1996, prior to the introduction of the visa, when domestic workers were brought to the UK on visit visas with no associated employment or immigration rights, 89% of those surveyed by Kalayaan reported being denied time off and 100% worked an average of 17 hours per day.  The proportion of people reporting physical abuse (39%) was over twice that reported in 2010, and the proportion reporting sexual abuse (12%) was four times as high as in 2010. There were also far higher levels of psychological abuse (87%) reported.                                                              6 Figures for prosecutions relating to the trafficking or forced labour of domestic workers cannot be confirmed officially as  7 UK Seventh Periodic Report to Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/equalities/international-equality/7th-cedaw-report?view=Binary  8 http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/crime/human-trafficking-strategy?view=Binary     Jenny Moss, Community Advocate   jenny@kalayaan.org.uk 0207 243 2942    17. The visa has been recognised as good practice by the International Labour Organisation9, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Human rights of Migrants specifically recommended retaining the visa safeguards and extended them to cover diplomatic domestic workers.10  General recommendation 26 of the CEDAW committee also recommends that migrant women workers be covered by employment legislation and that residence status should be independent of an employer.11  18. What concerns Kalayaan is the fact that the UK has suggested no alternative ways in which the trafficking, exploitation and abuse of domestic workers will be prevented.  Removing the visa is only   19. The issue of how domestic workers will be able to assert their rights to fair treatment at work if they lose their legal stay the moment they flee an abusive employer has also not been addressed.  Employers will know that if the visa of a domestic worker is tied to that specific employer, the worker will have no option but to submit rights violations.  Legislation in the UK criminalising trafficking and forced labour, which is already of limited effect, will be unworkable if victims are too scared to approach the authorities for fear of deportation.  Improvements are needed to promote and protect human rights 20. Many domestic workers are unaware of their rights and this makes them vulnerable to violations.  The UK Government should ensure that information is provided to domestic workers, at the point of application and in their own language, about their rights in the UK and where they can seek advice and support.   21. Undocumented migrant domestic workers are particularly vulnerable to violations of their human rights. The UK should consider providing bridging visas similar to the Irish scheme, that allows domestic workers whose legal stay has expired through no fault of their own (normally because an employer has withheld their identity documents and misled the domestic worker) to obtain short term permission to work and stay.  This would allow them to get back into work and apply to regularise their status with a new employer.  22. Even domestic workers who have valid visas find it difficult to challenge abusive practices, in part because they are misled about the nature of their visa and do not know their rights.  In part however from publically funded safe housing.  Short term safe housing to facilitate move on from abusive employment should be provided to domestic workers who do not meet the trafficking criteria.  The visa safeguards need extending to cover diplomatic domestic workers                                                            9 Draft ILO Multilateral Framework on Labour Migration Non binding principles and guidelines for a rights- based approach to labour migration, Geneva, 31 Oct- 2  10 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Jorge Bustamante, Mission to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, A/HRC/14/30/Add.3, 16 March 2010  11 http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/GR_26_on_women_migrant_workers_en.pdf     Jenny Moss, Community Advocate   jenny@kalayaan.org.uk 0207 243 2942   23.  As discussed above, diplomatic domestic workers are demonstrably more vulnerable to trafficking and rights violations than domestic workers in a private house.  General vulnerabilities are exacerbated by immigration status.  24. Diplomatic domestic workers need to be able to change employer in order to challenge and escape rights violations.  The right to change employer would not in and of itself conflict with diplomatic immunity.  It would however allow domestic workers to test the limits of diplomatic immunity in the civil and criminal courts as they would be able to come forward without fearing deportation.  This would arguably prove a deterrent to diplomats treating future domestic workers in this way.  25. Kalayaan are particularly concerned at the lack of a monitoring mechanism for potential rights violations by diplomats.  At present the UK Government is only aware of cases where the police have officially asked the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to request a waiver of immunity from the embassy concerned.  In a German Institute of Human Rights report12, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated that they knew only of three cases of alleged violations of domestic worker rights by diplomats whereas Kalayaan have referred nine cases of trafficking by diplomats through the national referral mechanism and eight cases have been reported to the police.   26. Most criminal investigations do not get to the stage of requesting a waiver of immunity because the police turn the victim away either because they are unable to identify the indicators of trafficking or they are not aware that they can investigate a diplomat.  In any case trafficking cases are notoriously difficult to prove and as such are often abandoned before they are fully investigated.  There are also other authorities who have information on potential rights violations perpetrated by diplomats including the NRM and the employment courts.   Key priorities for the UK with regard to slavery and domestic workers (Recommendations) 27. Retain the domestic worker visa including the right to change employer, to renew the visa and eligibility for settlement.  28. Improve protections for migrant domestic workers by (a) providing them with information about their rights and where to go for help (b) instituting a bridging visa for migrant domestic workers who have become undocumented through no fault of their own and (c) providing safe housing to migrant domestic workers who do not fit the criteria of trafficked person  29. Extend the protections of the domestic worker visa to diplomatic domestic workers, most notably the right to change employer, and institute a system to monitor alleged rights violations by diplomats  30.                                                             12 ss to justice in the context of diplomatic immunity.

46,LG - Leeds Gypsyand Traveller Exchange,"This submission to the UK UPR is written in the face of a very short deadline and is therefore brief.  The Executive Board of Leeds Gypsy and Traveller Exchange (Leeds GATE) wish to re-iterate to the authors of the UPR UK report the dire situation in respect of human rights of Gypsy and Irish Traveller people in the UK. Behind recent high profile headlines and attention grabbing television programmes Gypsy and Irish Traveller people remain, according to Dept of Health, Dept for Education and EHRC among others, amongst the most disadvantaged communities in the UK.  This disadvantage is underpinned by the failure of successive UK governments to recognise the right to specific land use by traditionally nomadic people.   On a weekly basis the UK courts are being used to remove the homes of Gypsy and Irish Traveller people from pieces of land.  We identify three problems which are having a significant impact on the right to family life and other human rights. UK law does not provide any statutory protection for the traditional land use needs of Gypsy and Irish Traveller people. The rights of Gypsy and Irish Traveller people to continue their traditional ways of life is not adequately protected and the actual area of land (in small parcels) available to Gypsy and Irish Traveller people for this purpose has been systematically eroded.   The UK planning system does not sufficiently  or other alternatives to bricks and mortar housing as a legitimate land use.  This is of significant detriment to family life for anyone not wishing to live in a house but most particularly is of detriment to Gypsy and Irish Traveller people.  And yet there are a incidencontracts, or to deal with homelessness as a result of floods.  Successive local authorities, particularly elected members, do not recognise Gypsy and Irish needs.  There is virtually no significant evidence of Local Authorities engaging in dialogue or negotiation to facilitate traditional nomadism and/or to resolve homelessness amongst Gypsy and Irish Traveller communities. We would draw attention to the plight of Mr James Connors as an exemplar.  On 27th May 2004 the European Court of Human Rights judged that Leeds City Council had violated Mr Connors Articand Traveller site at Cottingley Springs.  This judgement led to significant changes in security of tenure on local authority sites and has benefit a vast number of Gypsy and Irish Traveller families living on LAS sites.  However due to the failure of the city council in the intervening years to make any significant attempt to facilitate the provision of adequate site accommodation in Leeds, a significant number of  Leeds families, including Mr Connors, remain homeless.  Rather than recognise Mr Connors right to live, according to his culture and tradition, in a caravan and facilitating that, the LA has spent over £2 million since 2003 evicting Mr Connors from various pieces of public land around Leeds.  The detriment to Mr Connors health, privacy and family life are of huge significance.  This situation is repeated across England.  The courts are used punitively but no significant progress towards resolving the lack of appropriate stopping places is made, or even attempted. UK citizens of Gypsy or Irish Traveller ethnicity, alongside many other groups not wishing to live a majority housed lifestyle, are being abused by the UK government every day.

It is networked with a broad spectrum of international professional legal bodies, inter-governmental organisations, and non-governmental and civil society organisations.  3. The Society regularly writes reports and provides specialist submissions on these subjects to UK, international and inter-governmental bodies. Many of these reports are referenced in this submission.  .                                                                          1 The International Department of the Society connects with similar professional lawyers associations and civil society organisations across the world. The Department is divided into regional teams, each managed by a regional expert consulting with a specialist committee of international lawyers.  2 The Legal Policy Department at the Society reviews, comments and amends policy affecting the legal profession and the rule of law. It regularly submits evidence to Government. It undertakes its work by consulting with specialist committees. There is a specialist committee for each legal practice area. Committee members are legal practitioners who are experts in their field.   3   Legal Aid  4. The UK Government should consider alternative proposals for saving the required £350 million from the civil legal aid budget, in particular the 3  which makes the required savings while maintaining access to justice for those most in need.  5. In accordance with its commitment to operationalise the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human rights, in particular Guiding Principle 26, the Government should modify its proposal to limit the recoverability of costs.  6. The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill 2010-20114  (the 'Bill') will reform legal advice and access to justice in order to save £350 million.  7. This Bill makes changes that may prevent or deter hundreds of thousands of people from using the courts to assert their legal rights.  8. The Government's proposed reforms will take a number of key areas out of the scope of legal aid. This is a threat to access to justice for those needing legal assistance in cases of medical negligence, divorce, employment and welfare. These people will effectively be silenced, as their cases will go unheard without the support of a legal aid lawyer.5  9. The right to a fair trial, Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights and Article 14 of the International Covenant  are fundamental to the rule of law and to democracy itself. The right applies to both criminal and civil cases.  10. Legal aid clients are some of the most vulnerable people in society and good legal representation where required is essential if they are to be able effectively to enforce and defend their rights. Without that ability the rule of law is ""meaningless"".6  11. The Government's proposal to replace face-to-face legal aid with a telephone gateway service restricts access to justice particularly for the vulnerable such as the disabled community.7  12. Several reports have indicated that women will be disproportionately adversely affected especially in relation to cases of domestic violence. For women to access legal aid under the new system they will have to provide evidence under one of the 'gateways'. Evidence will need to be produced within the last 12 months before being granted legal aid. This fails to reflect women's experiences of domestic violence and fails to take into account the complex issues surrounding victims of domestic violence. Evidence is notoriously difficult to collect in cases of domestic violence as women do not officially report all                                                 3 : see http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/new/documents/2011/legalaid-missing-millions.pdf 4 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill 2010-11: http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/legalaidsentencingandpunishmentofoffenders.html 5 Law Society: Sound Off For Justice campaign: http://soundoffforjustice.org/legal-aid 6Former Law Society President, Linda Lee:  http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/newsandevents/news/majorcampaigns/view=newsarticle.law?CAMPAIGNSID=426269 7 Scrap telephone gateway says Law Society as proceedings issued against Ken Clarke: http://lawsocietymedia.org.uk/Press.aspx?ID=1511   4  incidents to the police and abuse other than physical (such as psychological and financial) are often tricky to evidence.8  13. If women are unable to access legal aid they are less likely to represent themselves in court proceedings. They would prefer the presence of a lawyer in court proceedings for support and a feeling of safety. It would also be inappropriate for a victim to attend court as a litigant in person and have to confront their alleged abuser.9 Mediation is not an appropriate solution for dealing with these complex issues.   14. For these reasons, the Bill potentially conflicts with Article 5 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women: both of which have been ratified by the UK and contain provisions that all persons should be equal before the law and/or guarantee equal legal protection against discrimination.   15. The Bill also contains provisions which deliver structural reforms to the administration of legal aid (through the abolition of the Legal Services Commission), reforms to payments to acquitted defendants from central funds litigation.10   16. Lord Justice Jackson set out recommendations on the reform of funding arrangements in his report Review of Civil Litigation Costs: Final Report, published on 14 January 2010.  17. The so-called Jackson reforms will significantly restrict the ability of claimants and their lawyers to recover legal costs from defendants. They will have particularly devastating consequences for human rights claims against multinational corporations ('MNCs'), as they threaten to make such claims economically unviable. This will affect not only claimants from the UK, but others from around the world who have often used UK courts to pursue human rights claims against MNCs.  18. The proposals include the abolition of the recoverability of certain fees as well as recoverability of premiums for After-the-Event insurance. These changes will make it extremely difficult for claimants financially to proceed leaving them   19. Also included is the introduction of a new test of proportionality in costs assessment. This would mean that MNCs would only have to pay the claimants' basic legal costs insofar as they are 'proportionate' to the compensation received.  20. In human rights cases, the issues are often complex and as a result the costs can be high but the victims are often pursuing the case for acknowledgement, vindication and justice. Thus, the principles in human rights cases are often worth the cost, even if it might seem, mathematically, disproportionate to the damages awarded.                                                  8 a research report: http://www.rightsofwomen.org.uk/pdfs/Policy/Womens_access_to_Justice-a_research_report.pdf; pg. 12 9 research report: http://www.rightsofwomen.org.uk/pdfs/Policy/Womens_access_to_Justice-a_research_report.pdf; pg. 15 10 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill 2010-11: http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/legalaidsentencingandpunishmentofoffenders.html   5  21. These proposals would not only deter claimants but also lawyers from taking complex yet important cases fearing that they would not be able to recover their costs. They will act as a barrier to justice to those who cannot afford to pursue legitimate claims.  22. The Bill has recently been criticised by the UN Special Representative for Business and Human Rights.11  His previously published guidelines (which recognised the principle of reducing barriers against access to justice for business-related human rights abuses)12 received strong support from the UK Government.     Bill of Rights  23. Following recent negative headlines and a hostile political climate for human rights in the UK, the Government set up a Commission on a Bill of Rights. Its mandate is to review the current system of implementing human rights in the UK, the Human Rights Act 1998, and propose whether it should be replaced or supplemented by a Bill of Rights.  24. The Society recommends13 that the Human Rights Act 1998 ('HRA') should be retained and should be accompanied by a programme of public education, outreach and debate to enhance understanding and legitimacy.  25. Additional rights could be added to the HRA, but no rights should be diluted or taken away. The Commission must ensure that it consults widely with civil society groups about their review.     Extradition  26. On 14 October 2010, the Secretary of State for the Home Department appointed Sir Scott Baker, a former High Court Judge, to conduct a review14 extradition arrangements.   27. The Society agrees with his recommendation that careful but urgent consideration, looking at both the financial implications and the interests of justice, is given by both the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office to reintroducing non means-tested legal aid for extradition proceedings in England, Wales and Scotland.  28. The Society made a submission to the Home Office, copied to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights15 ('JCHR'). The Society urged the review to                                                 11 See Guardian article: http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/jun/16/united-nations-legal-aid-cuts-trafigura?INTCMP=SRCH 12 mechanisms when addressing business-related human rights abuses, including considering ways to reduce legal,  13  Law Society response to bill of rights commission: http://international.lawsociety.org.uk/files/Law_Society_response_to_bill_of_rights_commission_final_web.pdf 14 :  http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/police/operational-policing/extradition-review?view=Binary 15 Inquiry into the human rights implic: http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/human-rights-committee/inquiries/uk-extradition-policy/   6  pay particular attention to legal aid in extradition cases.  The Society also noted that there had been criticism of the sufficiency of the scope of s jurisdiction in extradition cases.  In rare cases reliance on the powers available to courts may be an incomplete guarantee that the extradition process operates in the public interest. Instead one resorts to the residual safeguard of ministerial discretion to make representations to the requesting state.  The Society urges Government to perform its residual function responsibly and transparently so that all deserving cases are identified, and that its attention is not dominated solely by high-profile ones.    Compliance with European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) judgments  29. The Government should undertake a review of all ECtHR judgments that remain un-implemented and ensure that adequate steps are taken to comply.  30. In general, the UK has a good record of implementing judgments. The new Coalition Government has generally indicated willingness to implement (with few but notable exceptions).  31. The Society welcomes the fact that the Ministry of Justice ('MoJ') has taken over a number of administrative responsibilities from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and is now responsible for the domestic co-ordination of information between Government departments.  32. We also note the introduction of a specifically-designed form for Government departments to complete regarding the implementation of an adverse judgment. forward to the results of the MoJ's further review in the hope that more substantive measures will be proposed.  33. The Society is concerned that some ECtHR judgments have been outstanding for a long period of time and in certain cases the UK has received strong international criticism from the Committee of Ministers at the Council of Europe.16  34. High-profile non-compliance by Government with international judgments or repetitive breaches going unrectified will diminish respect for human rights generally in UK.    Reform of the ECtHR  35. as to reduce the backlog and make it more efficient. However, any proposals                                                     16 Law Society's response to the Parliamentary Jjudgments identifying breaches of human rights: http://international.lawsociety.org.uk/files/Law%20Society%20Evidence_Judgments%20Breaches%20of%20Human%20Rights.pdf   7   The Detainee Inquiry  36. The UK Government must ensure that the Detainee Inquiry is sufficiently transparent and sufficient evidence is heard from the appropriate agencies.  37. The Society welcomes the introduction of the Detainee Inquiry, chaired by Sir Peter Gibson and set up by the Prime Minister. The Detainee Inquiry was set up to look into whether, and if so to what extent, the UK Government or its security/intelligence agencies were involved in or knew about the improper treatment or rendition of detainees held by other countries in overseas counter-terrorism operations in which the UK played a part.   38. It was established in response to a media frenzy surrounding dozens of court cases against the Government including people accusing the British security forces of being complicit in their torture before they arrived at Guantanamo Bay.  39. Several organisations and lawyers have expressed concerns about the openness and transparency of the Detainee Inquiry.   40. The Detainee Inquiry has been criticised because most of the proceedings will be held behind closed doors, and foreign agencies such as the CIA will not be called to give evidence. This has led to many human rights organisations accusing the Inquiry of lacking credibility and transparency.   41. In particular 10 NGOs17 along with victims of torture and their lawyers have withdrawn18 from the Detainee Inquiry on the grounds that it cannot get to the truth about torture.19  42. Juan Mendez, the UN's Special Rapporteur on Torture, has expressed concern regarding the ""limitations"" of the Detainee Inquiry which he considers may frustrate its very object.20    Protection of Freedoms Bill ('Freedom Bill')  43. The Government should consider returning to the originally enacted 7 day period for the maximum detention period for terrorist suspects.  44. The provisions in the proposed Freedom Bill on the destruction, retention and use of DNA and fingerprints are welcome. The Society opposes in principle the indefinite retention of DNA profiles and fingerprints of people who have never been convicted of a crime.  45. We welcome the reduction in the maximum period for detention in terrorism investigations.  While the permanent reduction of the maximum detention period for terrorist suspects in the Terrorism Act 2000 from 28 to 14 days is very much                                                 17 ry http://www.reprieve.org.uk/press/2011_08_04_withdrawal_from_inquiry/ 18Letter addressed to Sara Carnegie, the Solicitor to the Detainee Inquiry: http://www.reprieve.org.uk/static/downloads/2011_08_03_PUB_NGO_withdrawal_from_Detainee_Inquiry_letter.pdf 19 Reprieve a http://www.reprieve.org.uk/press/2011_08_04_withdrawal_from_inquiry/ 20UN fears for British government inquiry into torture http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/nov/13/un-fears-british-torture-inquiry   8  supported, we consider that there is a case for considering the return to the originally enacted period of 7 days, which applied until the increase to 14 days was enacted in the Criminal Justice Act 2003.    Counter terrorism  46. The Society is concerned about the differential treatment of suspects under counter terrorism measures and recommends that they should be treated in the same way as other suspects in criminal matters.   47. The Society is concerned about the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Bill. Alternative measures should be employed by the Government to avoid the draconian restrictions on liberty that the existing regime of control orders imposes.   48. The Society welcomes attempts to create a more proportionate regime because the control order system is both unsafe and unfair. It allows the indefinite imposition of serious punishments such as house arrest and internal exile by the Home Secretary on the basis of charges, evidence or proof.   49. However the new regime changes little and still imposes significant restrictions on liberty including a nightly curfew, electronic tagging and severely restricted communication, which potentially conflicts with Article 9 and 17 of the ICCPR.  50. Unless the regime has sufficient safeguards, it will not adequately protect the right to liberty (Article 5) and the right to a fair trial (Article 6) as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights.    The Interception of private communications (""phone hacking"")  51. The Leveson Inquiry is a public inquiry set up by the Prime Minister on 6 July 2011 to look into issues arising from the News International phone hacking scandal.   52. The Inquiry's remit is to inquire into the culture, practices, and ethics of the press, and make recommendations, e.g. for a new more effective policy and regulatory regime.  It  will also look into the specific claims about phone hacking at the News of the World  newspaper, the initial police investigation and allegations of illicit payments to police by the press.  53. The Society has received concerns from members of the legal profession who had been notified by the police about possible criminal activity in relation to the hacking of their phones.  It later emerged that newspapers have also been following lawyers and carrying out surveillance on them. 21    54. Aside from the breach of privacy (Article 8 European Convention on Human Rights) for both the lawyers and their clients if these allegations are shown to be                                                 21 Phone hacking: Lawyer to sue over NoW surveillance http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15636826   9  true, the suggestion that the information was gathered specifically to undermine their legal claims against the newspaper introduces new questions about how the practice of phone hacking was used.  55. It is particularly of concern if these practices were carried out with the intention of undermining court action, because it could constitute an attempt to pervert the course of justice.  56. The Society considers that these are serious allegations and merit specific consideration by the Inquiry.    The riots which took place in August 2011  57. The Government should give due consideration to the concerns expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ('the Committee')  to ensure sentencing applied to the August Riots is proportionate.  58. Riots broke out in August of this year in cities around the UK. The Committee commented in September 2011. The Committee expressed concern that the response to the riots may disproportionately impact groups from poor and minority ethnic backgrounds. In particular the Committee referred to reported plans to remove the welfare benefits of those convicted but not jailed for riot-related offences, and to evict families of those involved in the riots from social housing. Such measures have the potential to worsen race relations and inequalities in the UK (contrary to Articles: 2, 4 and 6 of CERD22).    Privacy/Defamation  59. The right to freedom of expression is presently under legislative consideration in a number of contexts where it comes into conflict with other rights, primarily defamation and privacy law. A Draft Defamation Bill is currently being consulted on, which the Society is concerned will place too great an emphasis on freedom of expression over the right to protect reputation.23 The Society also responded to a call for evidence by the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions arguing against a statutory privacy law, which would unbalance the relationship between the rights to free expression and privacy.24                                                         22 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 23 Joint Committee on the Draft Defamation Bill, Written evidence: Page 86 http://www.parliament.uk/documents/joint-committees/Draft%20Defamation%20Bill/Final%20Written%20Evidence%20Vol%20III.pdf  24Joint Committee on privacy and injunctions, Oral and written evidence: Page 106 http://www.parliament.uk/documents/joint-committees/Privacy_and_Injunctions/JCPIWrittenEvWeb.pdf    10   Optional protocols and treaty ratifications  60. The Society recommends that the UK reviews whether it can enhance human rights protection by ratifying the optional protocols to and/or removing reservations from the following treaties: UNCAT, ECHR (in particular Protocol 12), ICCPR, ICESCR, ICERD, CEDAW, CRPD, CRC.25        The Law Society of England and Wales November 2011                                                                                  25 Respectively: Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, European Convention on Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Convention on the Rights of the Child.

48,Mencap - Mencap,"Mencap 123 Golden Lane London  EC1Y 0RT Tel:  020 7454 0454 Fax:  020 7608 3254             www.mencap.org.uk      Submission to  UN Universal Periodic Review UK's examination (13th Session - 2012)  About Mencap  Mencap supports the 1.5 million people with a learning disability in the UK and their families and carers. Mencap fights to change laws and improve services and access to education, employment and leisure facilities, supporting thousands of people with a learning disability to live their lives the way they want.  We are also one of the largest providers of services, information and advice for people with a learning disability across England, Northern Ireland and Wales. See www.mencap.org.uk for more information.   About learning disability  A learning disability is caused by the way the brain develops before, during or shortly after birth. It is always life-long and affects someone's intellectual and social development. It used to be called mental handicap but this term is outdated and offensive. Learning disability is NOT a mental illness. The term learning difficulty is often incorrectly used interchangeably with learning disability.  Introduction  Mencap has supported the submissions made on behalf of Disability Rights Watch UK and the British Institute of Human Rights and fully endorses the positions taken by those submissions. However, there are some areas of concern specific to the rights of people with learning disabilities that warranted an additional submission.  In particular the needs of people with profound and multiple learning disabilities have not always been met sufficiently and there is a concern that this may prevent their enjoyment of their rights. In particular limited access to advocacy, day time activities and adequate healthcare services is likely to restrict their right to community and family life and access to healthcare and justice obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  People with profound and multiple learning disabilities (PMLD) are unique individuals but sometimes it is helpful to talk about groups of people who have common concerns, have distinctive needs, face barriers to being included and who need help to fight for their equal rights.    www.mencap.org.uk  Registered charity number 222377    1. People with profound and multiple learning disabilities:   have more than one disability   have a profound learning disability   have great difficulty communicating   need high levels of support   may have additional sensory or physical disabilities  may have complex health needs or mental health difficulties   may have behaviours that challenge us.   Recent research estimates that there are just over 16,000 adults with PMLD in England.1  This is a relatively small and easily identifiable group, yet their support needs are particularly high. Indeed, research by Mencap showed that 60% of parents of children and adults with PMLD spent more than ten hours a day on essential physical care and a third of these said that they were caring for their son or daughter 24 hours a day.2  In March 2010, Professor Jim Mansell published his report Raising our sights, which was commissioned by the Department of Health which highlighted the challenges facing many adults with PMLD and their parents and carers. It offered 33 recommendations on how to improve the lives of these individuals and the Government said that it would respond to each of the recommendations.  This response was published on 10th February 2011. Mencap is disappointed with the recommendations and, therefore, to ensure that the lives of people with PMLD and their families and carers are improved. Mencap is concerned that, as a result of a lack of action regarding this issue, people with PMLD will remain marginalised, without the support they need to achieve an acceptable standard of life, and families caring for adults with PMLD at home will continue to be pushed towards breaking point as they struggle on without appropriate support.   2. Advocacy and access to justice  The Government has determined that determined that advocacy services should be commissioned by local commissioners and advocacy service provision should be advanced by councils. Furthermore the cuts in Legal Aid for advocacy services mean that people may struggle to get proper representation. This is because under proposals of the Legal Aid, sentencing and punishment of Offenders Bill, Legal aid will be cut for people representing others in a number of cases. If people are denied access to justice as a result it would be a serious breach of their human rights and Mencap would like to see the government take steps to protect legal aid for advocacy and to over reassurances that it                                             1 Emerson, E. (2009) Estimating future numbers of adults with profound and multiple learning disabilities in England. Lancaster: Centre for Disability Research 2 http://www.mencap.org.uk/document.asp?id=1671&audGroup=&subjectLevel2=&subjectId=&sorter=1&origin=pageType&pageType=112&pageno=&searchPhrase=    www.mencap.org.uk  Registered charity number 222377    intends to ensure people with PMLD and those who support them have access to due legal representation  Recommendations:   - Mencap seeks clarification on how the specific support and advocacy needs of people with PMLD will be identified and provided in local areas.  - The government should take steps to ensure that advocacy services for people with PMLD are adequately funded, and that there is sufficient monitoring of these services make sure that the needs of people with PMLD are being met.   3. Access to the community and living independently  The ability to access community is an essential part of the rights of people with PMLD. The UNCRPD states that disabled people should be able to live independently and be included in the community. Mencap is concerned that progress in this area is limited, particularly with regard to people with PMLD.  Changing places facilities  The government is currently reviewing Building Regulations with consideration of including Changing Places Facilities within Part M (Access to and use of buildings) of the Building Regulations.  These facilities include additional features such as a hoist, adult changing bench and extra space for carers to support someone to access toilet facilities. Without these facilities, a person with PMLD may be severely limited in their access to community facilities and may be faced with the choice of being subject to degrading treatment of being changed in unsuitable, unhygienic conditions or not going out at all.  Assistive technology  Communication aid and assistive technology help people with PMLD to access the community live independently and enjoy their private and family life effectively.  The government has said that it is committed to implementing Article 25 of the UN Convention which specifically addresses rights in health and social care. In addition it is running a large randomised control of telehealth and telecare (Whole System Demonstrator programme) which will provide the best evidence base possible for local commissioners to make decisions about how best to use this type of technology to support locally assessed needs.   It has however said that it the decision about funding the provision and repair of communication aids for adults with PMLD is the responsibility of the NHS or the Local Authority. Mencap is concerned that there is no leadership from the Government as to how information about assistive technologies and communication aids will be achieved, as per   www.mencap.org.uk  Registered charity number 222377    the Raising our sights recommendations. We also seek assurances that the large trial on telehealth and telecare will address the specific needs of adults with PMLD as this is often not the case. It is unclear therefore about how much guidance the government will give to local authorities or how it will ensure local authorities are meeting their obligations to provide this support. An effective guidance and monitoring system would enable a consistency of access in all authorities whilst also helping to drive up standards.  Employment and day activity  Mencap welcomes the governmentdetermination that all people with learning disabilities  including people with PMLD  should be supported to have fulfilling lives including opportunities to work, study and enjoy social and leisure activities.  However despite this commitment to help ensure that people with PMLD are part of all plans and opportunities and that reasonable adjustments should be made, we would call for greater leadership from government by offering further guidance on this and disseminating best practice. This is particularly the case around encouraging Local Authorities to continue to provide somewhere which can be used as a base from which adults with PMLD can go to different activities during the day.   Access to education  The government had previously committed to local FE provision for all young people aged 16-19 with learning disabilities as part of the SEN Green Paper. It has also highlighted the fact that Skills Funding Agency regularly publishes data on the number of learning aims achieved by learners with a self-declared learning difficulty or disability.  Despite Raising our sights making it clear that a specific focus on improving access to FE for young adults with PMLD is needed, the Government does not seem to have any plans to focus on the specific needs of this group. The Skills Funding Agency data is not broken down to give information about students with PMLD and, at present, there is no data about the volume and quality of FE provision for people with PMLD (with no indication that there are plans to start collecting this information).  We have now seen the Green paper on SEN and Disabilities and there does not appear to be a specific focus on the needs of this group in relation to accessing appropriate FE.     Short breaks  The government has announced  that there is extra funding for carers breaks over the next 4 years through a £400 million investment (as set out in Recognised, valued and 2010) along with additional funding in PCT baselines to support the provision of breaks for carers made available in the Spending Review.   www.mencap.org.uk  Registered charity number 222377     Mencap calls for greater Government leadership to encourage local areas to ensure that short break services are commissioned which specifically meet the needs of people with PMLD. This is crucial as so often short break provision does not have the staff skills and expertise needed.  Recommendations:   - The Government should extend Building Regulations to ensure that all new buildings must include Changing Places facilities to enable people.  - There is useful existing research and practice on the use of communication aids and assistive technology for adults with PMLD. Mencap calls on the Government to commission the review and dissemination of this.  - Mencap calls on the Government to check that local areas have worked out whether the funding for the provision and repair of communication aids for adults with PMLD is the responsibility of the NHS or Local Authorities, so that lack of clarity on this does not continue to make access to communication aids difficult for people with PMLD.  - Mencap asks the Government to seek commitment from Local Authorities to develop plans and opportunities for meaningful activities for people with PMLD.  - Mencap would like to see a policy commitment to improving access to Further Education for people with PMLD in order to help funding bodies develop appropriate objectives and plans. We would like all work being done to improve access to FE for people with learning disabilities to include a specific workstream focusing on young people with PMLD. Mencap would like the Government to ensure that the funding provided for short breaks, referred to in their response, reaches people with PMLD who have the highest level of need.      4. Access to Health care  Article 25 of the UNCRPD declares that governments should provide access to healthcare for disabled people. There are concerns that recommendations from the Raising our sights report have not yet been implemented to ensure people with PMLD have adequate healthcare services  Healthcare for people with PMLD  The government claims that the needs of people with a learning disability are covered by the NHS Operating Framework 2011/12 and the Confidential Inquiry into premature and   www.mencap.org.uk  Registered charity number 222377    avoidable deaths of people with learning disabilities and the Public Health Observatory for people with learning disabilities. It has stated that that NHS bodies should already be ensuring that services meet the needs of all patients  including those with PMLD  and are required to comply with the Equality Act 2010 and from April 2011 its Equality Duty.3   Mencap is disappointed that the Government has not taken on board the Raising our sights recommendation that the Board of each NHS Trust should consider a report specifically focused on the adequacy of health services for adults with PMLD and approve an action plan to ensure adequate treatment. We are concerned that this will see a continuation of a lack of focus on this group when it comes to healthcare.  Clinical procedures  high quality person-centred transition plans are housing, employment and community participation and that the New Health and Wellbeing Boards will help meet needs in a joined up way.  However we believe that there is a lack of detail in this response and that it does not adequately address the Raising our sights recommendations about clinical procedures. We would like to see it call on Local Authorities to develop local policies about clinical procedures in all relevant care settings or offer assistance with this.   Recommendations:   - Mencap would like to see progress made around the health of people with PMLD including better monitoring of the uptake of health checks, provision of health services and improved planning to ensure adequate treatment.  - Mencap would like to see central guidance from the Department of Health on how local arin services for adults.   Conclusions  Mencap feels it necessary that in addition to the achievements, issues and challenges outlined in submissions coordinated by Disability Rights Watch UK and the British Institute of Human Rights, the unique challenges faced by people with PMLD in enjoying their rights merits an additional response focussed on those challenges alone.  The government has made a wide number of promises and assurances on access to services which would allow people with PMLD to enjoy their community and family life and                                             3 New organisations established as part of the health and social care reform programme, for example GP commissioning consortia, will be covered by this Duty   www.mencap.org.uk  Registered charity number 222377    to access high quality healthcare. However these promises are not always translating into visible improvements in the way people with PMLD can secure their rights.  We have made a number of reccomendations which we urge the government to consider as part of the Universal periodic Review Process, with a particular emphasis on accessing the community and independent living including education, healthcare and adequate legal representation.

49,NCADC - National Coalition of Anti Deportation Campaigns," 1   The Universal Periodic Review contribution of THE NATIONAL COALITION OF ANTI-DEPORTATION CAMPAIGNS (NCADC)    www.ncadc.org.uk  NCADC South Praxis Community Projects, Pott Street, London E2 0EF  NCADC North Govan & Craigton Integration Network,  Pearce Institute,  840 Govan Road, Glasgow G51 3UU   2 1. Through its work with individuals either seeking asylum or facing deportation or removal from the United Kingdom, NCADC is aware of a number of human rights violations stemming from the such individuals. This report deals with two issues which were recommended for improvement in the first UPR session, namely the treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) asylum seekers by the UK government and judiciary; and the use of covert means of removing those whose asylum status has been refused.  The report provides an analysis of the recent developments in these areas. The report then raises a number of other areas of concern which NCADC believes to be in need of attention by the UK authorities in order for the UK to honour its various international human rights treaty obligations.   2. sufficient account of an indisidering their claim for asylum: indeed, 98% of asylum cases involving LGBT individuals in the UK were refused. NCADC is pleased to note positive developments in this area. Since the last UPR report the UK Supreme Court has ruled that it is not sufficient for the test of risk of persecution or serious harm to be whether an LGBT individual could live discreetly in their country of origin (as was previously the case, in marked contrast to the test regarding political beliefs) .   3. This welcome judgement notwithstanding, the experiences of NCADC in asylum cases involving LGBT individuals have suggested the judgement in itself is not sufficient to protect individuals who would face persecution and   3 serious harm if returned.  This is due to the poor quality of first instance decision-making by the UK Border Agency in all cases but particularly those status is credible.   These poor decisions have, in a worryingly high number of cases in which NCADC has been involved, also been upheld in the Immigration Courts.   NCADC is highly concerned about the reasons given for LGBT identity are routinely interpreted as incredible claims by the UKBA, despite vast research on this being a normal and valid reaction to hiding sexual identity in country of origin, and traumatic experiences undergone because of their sexual identity.  Having children, or opposite sex partners, or even in one case the use of contraceptive devices, have all been cited by the UKBA as believes that this reflects homophobia and a culture of disbelief in the UK governmbeing put at risk.  4. Furthermore, there have been a number of instances where the courts have failed to take account of the dangers posed by certain states to the LGBT community. Most notably a number of clients of NCADC who had been confirmed by the UKBA to be homosexuals were refused asylum on the grounds that the court did not believe that a significant risk was posed to them by the Ugandan authorities, despite the recent reintroduction of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill into the Ugandan Parliament. NCADC has also worked with a number of clients who had suffered serious injuries at the hands of the   4 communities of their country of origin but who have yet had their claims for asylum refused on the basis that the court does not believe there to be a risk to the individual should they return, often without consideration of the medical evidence available.   5.  chartered flights, to remove individuals from the UK who have had their claims for asylum refused.  NCADC can report that its own area, which allows the UK authorities to remove individuals covertly. Indeed it notes also (and particularly families) refused asylum via dawn raids. This practice serves to terrorise individuals and families (especially children picked up in these raids) who have experienced heavy-handed tactics such as this in their country of origin.  operations need be so secretive, but they do little for the image of an asylum system which is supposed to be transparent and public. NCADC therefore would like to reiterate the call for more information to be provided by the UK government about the reasons for the continued use of these covert practices.  6. Furthermore NCADC has borne witness to a number of other human rights session. Most notably the procedures applied by the UKBA have often proven to be inadequate. In particular the NCADC recalls a case in which an individual was refused the right to appeal the decision to deny their application   5 for asylum due to the fact that the notification of refusal had been addressed incorrectly by the UKBA. Consequently the notification of refusal could not s client, who in turn was unable to apply for an appeal within the narrow time limit demanded by the UKBA, calling into question the UDHNCADC has had direct involvement in cases where the UKBA has failed to provide any reason for the rejection of bail applications of clients detained subsequent to their having their asylum claims refused, or where the UKBA has provided reasons for their refusal of bail which were not applicable to a client.   7. NCADC would also like to express its concerns over the increasing use of immigration detention in the UK, particularly in the cases of migrant individuals with close family or community ties in the UK; medical or mental health concerns; and individuals who have experienced detention, torture and rape in their country of origin.  While UK immigration law does not allow for individuals who have survived torture to be detained (apart from in exceptional circumstances), NCADC is concerned about the fallibility of decision-making in this area and inadequate regard being given to medical reports (or access not being granted to produce these reports in the first place) attesting to an individual having undergone torture.  Of further concern to NCADC is the frequent movement of individuals in detention (one NCADC client from Iraq was moved between 8 different Immigration Removal Centres; and more recently an individual has been moved four times within a advice (with the possible consequence of denial of access to justice), and   6 medical and mental health services that are so often required for this client group.  NCADC calls for the end to immigration detention  an inhumane and costly practice  and in the alternative recommends vastly improved scrutiny of decisions to place individuals into the fast-track system; immigration detention generally; and of temporary admission and BAIL applications.  8. Finally the NCADC wishes to also raise the detrimental effect that the UK government has introduced severe cuts to the legal aid budget and highly damaging changes to the way legal fees are paid, which has resulted in a to asylum seekers collapsing (including Refugee and Migrant Justice, and the Immigration Advisory Service). The consequence of these collapses has meant their cases stalled or even refused. NCADC has not seen any attempt by the UK government to rectify this state of affairs, and the quality and quantity of free legal advice has been steadily deteriorating.  With limited legal options available, especially to those in immigration detention who only have access to certain legal firms selected for the IRC contract, access to justice has been compromised in the vast majority of cases with which NCADC has been involved.  9. While NCADC welcomes the recent changes which prevent a claim for asylum being refused on the basis that an applicant may conceal their sexuality   7 on return to their country of origin, it holds that the UK authorities have a largely similar approach to LGBT asylum cases as in place prior to the change (with refusals of asylum claims now seemingly intent on circumventing the protection afforded by the landmark Supreme Court case), and in particular fails to have an adequate test to qualify the sexuality of an individual seeking asylum, and fails to also take seriously evidence which shows an LGBT individual to be at risk should they return to their country of origin. Furthermore NCADC raises concern as to the ert operations to detain and remove those individuals who have had their right to asylum refused, as well as the procedural inadequacy which the UKBA has consistently displayed, leading to the interruption of asylum seekeand legal help. NCADC would also like to recommend the cessation of the movement of asylum seekers around the UK whilst their claim is being made.  Finally NCADC would also recommend that the UK rethink its plans to cut legal aid and prevent the inevitable breach of asylum seeketo justice that would ensue.   10.  The overwhelmingly majority of individuals who contact NCADC for help have compelling asylum or human rights claims in the UK.  The fact that these individuals have reached the end of the asylum process and are facing removal indicates the poor quality of first-instance decision making by UKBA, and to a lesser extent, by the Immigration Courts.  NCADC recommends that the UK government implements improvements in keeping with UNHCR recommendations following a review of its decision-making.  Increased training for caseowners and all UKBA staff is needed, as evidence of racism   8 and brutality by UKBA staff (or enforcement staff contracted by UKBA) continues to come to light.    11. NCADC calls for the UK government to undertake a meaningful, independent review of its asylum decision-making system, to allow a robust asylum system to be implemented: a system that is not based on refusals for minor discrepancies, or a system that produces refusal letters riddled with errors, and a system that does not take disbelief as a starting point.   As a key advocate of human rights abroad, it is essential that the UK government is more than just a signatory in name to the Refugee convention and international human rights conventions, and reflects its values of freedom and fairness in its decision making and treatment of those seeking safety in the UK.

Gypsy people are an ethnic minority group as are Irish Travellers and both are protected under the Race Relations Act 1976 however the contentious issues of s of planning law undermines their protection as a right, but is determined by work patterns at the time of the application for planning permission. Recent homelessness legislation has assisted, but the issues now appear very unclear, blurring those that may be statutory homeless perceived traditional and ethnic right to live in caravans, knowing no other way of life and who are statutory homeless because there is nowhere legal to place their caravans. The planning circular 1/2006, (February 2006) Planning for Gypsy and Traveller Caravan Sites and the amendments to the Housing Act 2004 which set out that there should be assessments of Gypsy & Traveller accommodation needs, have meant that over the last four years there has been progress; however, recently, the new Coalition Government announced its intention to revoke this circular with -t To stop us regressing, Statute specifically for Gypsy people, Irish Travellers and Show men is the only answer.  There has been historic legislation against Gypsy people as a people1 and other legislation through many centuries, much intended for greater good has had a negative impact on the traditional Traveller community. As shared access to common land has been reduced in the latter five decades the Gypsy people have been locked in a struggle for recognition of their traditional way of life, which is not just one of movement but of cultural practice, and to many, identifies itself as a cultural aversion to bricks and mortar                                                  1 The Egyptian Acts, starting in 1530 were directly targeted at the Gypsy people others for example that have influenced and changed the people are, Vagrancy Act 1714 Enclosure of the Commons Act 1876, The Highways Act 1959, Caravans Sites Act 1960.  accommodation. Culturally acceptable accommodation2 has caused further interpretation with regard to housing law. There is something fundamentally wrong with a system where a person has to often have a combination of ill health through the material considerations3 in planning law and prove a mental anguish with regard to a cultural aversion to present their case. The system does not recognise that the Show people also have a traditional and hereditary right, which is not ethnic but a traditional right all the same. There needs to be improved access to culturally appropriate accommodation for the Gypsy and Traveller communities and these needs to be undertaken by appropriate statute and in time for the new planning policy proposed by the Government.  We would urge that in the light of the abolition of Regional Spatial Strategies and the proposed new Planning Policy Statement for Gypsy and Traveller sites [this PPS loses the word Gypsy and spells traveller with a small t] that we are at a convenient time to re-discuss the issue of status and statute for the indigenous Gypsy and Traveller communities of England and Wales and we would hope that this can be put forward as a recommendation.  Human Rights Act 1998 [HRA] In Chapman4  special consideration should be given to their needs and their different lifestyle both in the relevant regulatory framework and in reaching                                                  2 With regard to offer of conventional housing see Clarke v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the regions and Tunbridge wells BC  [2001] EWHC Admin 800       3 Material considerations with regard to  planning law can be   health,  education and other issues and are a consideration for the Planning Inspector in making a planning decision. 4 Chapman v UK [2001] 33 EHRR 399    on Contracting States by virtue of Article 8 to facilitate the gypsy way 5  Our question for the review is where is our statute as a positive obligation? It is likely that there will be further cases brought before the EU Court on this issue.  The HRA has brought about some significant changes around the area of eviction and the instability of families residing on local authority Gypsy sites that were exempt from the Mobile Homes Act 1983. The Connors6 judgement meant that UK law was incompatible with the HRA. It has been frustrating for many that for many years after the Connors judgment; there was no headway.7 The Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, had provisions within it under s318 to bring local authority sites under the provisions of the MHA. However, cases still followed Connors for many years where families could be evicted within the 28 day notice rule8 In Doherty9 The family were evicted and not allowed to put their case.  One of the more positive aspects of the coalition government is their intention to bring in security of tenure and to do this they announced that they would amend s5 (1) MHA 1983, which in effect bring in the excluded local authority Gypsy Sites under the MHA provision.  The Race Relations Act 1976 has ensured that the communities are protected, but only so far, the issue of traditional land and accommodation use remains to be unaddressed.                                                  5 ibid (p96) 6 Connors v UK (2005) 40 EHRR 9  7  Post Connors  the Department of Communities and Local Government produced Gypsy and Travellers Site Management: Good Practice Guide July 2009. This guide alludes to how pitches should be allocated and sites managed. 8 Before Connors, families could be evicted from  a site with only 7 days notice,  9 Doherty v Birmingham City Council [2008] 3 WLR 636  Planning law is necessary, but within it there needs to be recognition of traditional nomadic rights for this small community. Housing law has definitely assisted especially around the issue of evictions, but unfortunately it cannot seem to retract itself from the conventional form of accommodation.  The combination of planning and housing law gives concern in that the system requires problems to live as their forefathers lived. Arguably, the traditional Traveller communities are indigenous and cultural land rights should now be within an improved definition and statute and supported by European legislation.  The HRA1998 can only assist by influencing domestic law and it is time now for Europe to revisit the subject of definition with regard to  indigenous nomadic groups. Previous definitions have been written without the most important aspect, that is the use of the land and traditional accommodation practices. Other criteria such as linguistic leaves communities weak10, it does not give protection where it matters.  We would like the consideration of a revisit to for a recommendation; this would also help and assist other nomadic groups like the Sami in Europe  All indigenous minorities have comparable characteristics, based around community: very often shared community rights not an individual right, when it comes down to individuals, the fact that the economic definition discriminates against Gypsy and Traveller women is the same as the non-status Native Indian argument that developed in the USA  and  Canada11 and it is quite plainly wrong. At this present  time in  Britain  at the onset of the Equality Act,  Gypsy and Traveller women are at a disadvantage  which  fundamentally effects their human                                                  10 For example the Sami people 11 Men inheriting the headrights to land  rights, the present definition of gypsy status being one as an economic one and not one of tradition. mean blood quantum, it never has and  often  representative groups have been purposely misrepresented on this issue, but a definition that is of a traditional and hereditary right could be the way forward.  To apply a community traditional definition will assist families who have children who may work from an established site. Splitting families into those that deserve the right and those that are undeserving12 is again quite plainly wrong and not helpful in the present climate where social inclusion and improved employment prospects can be circumvented by a planning decision and in the light of the European Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 announced in April 2011.                                                        12  or the children of a traditional family not because they have organised paid work have been made.

51,OCC - Office of the Childrens Commissioner,"                (OCC):  Submission to the United Nations Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review  13th session 2012  United Kingdom  November 2011    www.childrenscommissioner.gsi.gov.uk            OCC submission to the Universal Periodic Review 13th session 2012  United Kingdom         2  1. Introduction  1.1 In accordance with the remit of the Office of the CCommissioner (OCC) -persons aged under 18 but our remit also includes young people aged 18-20 inclusive who have been in the care of a local authority when aged 16 or over or who have a learning disability.  2. Developments since previous review   2.1 We highlight the following developments as being of particular importance to   Normative and institutional framework:   2.2 The Government has set up an independent Commission on a Bill of Rights in order to consider the case for the creation of a domestic Bill of Rights. The  European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). We recommend that any UK Bill of Rights should include specific hts guaranteed by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNRCR), in addition to general rights not incorporated by the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA), including justiciable socio-economic rights and the right of access to a tribunal where rights have been violated.    Legislation  2.3 The Equality Act 2010 protects people from discrimination (direct and indirect), related harassment or victimisation and sexual harassment in a range of settings by reference to a range of protected characteristics. In relation to goods, facilities, services and public functions, however, its age discrimination protections do not apply to discrimination against children under 18. The Act also imposes a general duty on public authorities to eliminate discrimination, advance equality and foster good relations between groups. However, this duty does not apply in relation to age duty does not apply at all in relation to age discrimination against children.  We recommend that children be given the full protection of the Equality Act against age discrimination, with specific exceptions as appropriate.   National jurisprudence   2.4 In EM (Lebanon) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 64 the House of Lords (prior to the creation of the UK Supreme Court) prevented the removal of a non-EU national child and his mother where removal would have          OCC submission to the Universal Periodic Review 13th session 2012  United Kingdom         3  resulted in the mother losing custody of the child in favour of a father whom he did not know.  Their rights under Article 8 ECHR would have effectively been nullified by the removal. We welcome this decision.  2.5 a non-EU national whose children were UK citizens in ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4, where the UK Supreme Court found that the best interests of the child had to be a primary consideration in deciding whether the removal was proportionate under Article 8 ECHR.   2.6 In Re E (Children) [2011] UKSC 27, the Supreme Court also applied the best interests principle, finding that the best interests of the child had to be the primary consideration in cases under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980.   2.7 We welcome ts use recommend that in all actions and decisions concerning children the welfare and best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.    2.8 In A v Essex County Council [2010] UKSC 33 the Supreme Court, in relation to the right to education of a disabled child, did not agree that the right to education under Art 2, Protocol 1 ECHR imposed a positive obligation to provide education catering for the special needs of those who could not profit from mainstream education, but merely to provide access to the mainstream education system without discrimination.    Human Rights infrastructure including NHRIs   2.9 The Public Bodies Bill, currently before Parliament, will allow Ministers to modify the constitutional and funding arrangements and modify or transfer functions of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), by secondary legislation which Parliament will be able to reject but not to amend. The Government has also consulted  a more equal and human-rights respecting society and good relations between groups, and has decided to stop funding some of the EHRing the EHRC1  In our view these developments are   2.10 The Dunford Review of the 2 has recommended that legislation make                                             1 Government Equalities Office, Building a Fairer Britain: Reform of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, March 2011. 2 Department for Education, CM 7981, December 2010.

Scope of international obligations  2.11 The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (the Charter) became directly effective in UK law in December 2009 when the Lisbon Treaty came into force, in all matters in which EU law is engaged. The Charter gives specific and also includes civil/political and socio-economic rights including the right to education and the prohibition on child labour.  The UK entered a protocol to the treaty aimed at limiting the effect of the Charter in the UK;4 however, the effect of this protocol awaits clarification in the European Court of Justice case of NS v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Principles of Community law)5.    2.12 UNCRC regarding immigration and citizenship and the accommodation of children in custody separately from adults.  2.13 Optional Protocol to the UNCRC on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.  However, the UK maintains its declarations to the Optional Protocol to the UNCRC on the involvement of children in armed conflict.      3. Promotion and Protection of human rights on the ground  3.1 and protection of human rights on the ground is mixed.  Frequent ministerial criticism of the HRA, domestic human rights judgments and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has continued. The UK government has stated that one priority of its newly-assumed chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe strengthen subsidiarity  new rules or procedures to help ensure that the Court plays a subsidiary role where 6  We are concerned that any such measures should not weaken the role of the court in protecting and promoting the rights of children where these are not respected by the domestic system.                                                3 See General Assembly Resolution 48/134 of 20 December 2003. 4 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:0156:0157:EN:PDF. 5 [2011] EUECJ C-493/10 (22 September 2011. 6 Council of Europe Committee of Ministers, Priorities of the United Kingdom chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, CM/Inf(2011)41, 27 October 2011.           OCC submission to the Universal Periodic Review 13th session 2012  United Kingdom         5   Implementation of international human rights  3.2 In relation to the implementation of UN treaty body recommendations and particularly those from the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC): the session of the CRC.7 However, following the General Election and change of government in 2010, the new Government is not committed to this plan and no new plan has been published. We recommend that following the publication of Concluding Observations by the CRC and other treaty bodies, the Government publish comprehensive national action plans detailing how their recommendations will be implemented.    3.3 In Wales, the devolved administration has passed the Rights of Children and Young Persons Wales (Measure) 2011 which requires all Welsh Ministers to have due regard to the rights and obligations in the UNCRC and its Optional Protocols when carrying out their functions.  The Scottish Government in September 2011 published its Consultation on Rights of Children and Young People Bill which would have the same effect in Scotland.  These developments have not been mirrored in England although the Minister for Children Sarah Teather has made a public making new policy and legislation. We recommend that the UK incorporate the rights in the UNCRC and its Optional Protocols, in particular those rights not already incorporated by the HRA.   3.4 We also recommend that Government departments be subject to a statutory duty to carry out and publish Child Rights Impact Assessments in relation to proposed policies and legislation.    Cooperation with human rights mechanisms  3.5 The Government has failed to implement the final judgment of the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR relating to prisoner voting.8  While this does not affect children directly, it is a worrying precedent.   We recommend that the Government comply with all final judgments of the ECtHR, as required by the ECHR.    4. Identification of achievements, best practices, challenges and constraints in relation to implementation of accepted recommendations and development of human rights situations in the state  Implementation of accepted recommendations                                             7 Department for Children, Schools and Families, UN Convention on the Rights of the Child: priorities for action, 2009.  8 Hirst v UK (No 2), app no 74025/01, Grand Chamber judgment of 6 October 2005.

Recommendation 2: Consider removal of its reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.   Recommendation 25: Withdraw its reservation against the Convention on the Rights of the Child, concerning the provision that detained children be separated from adults while in detention, as well as the withdrawal of their reservation concerning refugee and asylum seeking children.    4.2 See above at paragraphs 2.13  2.14.  In relation to immigration and asylum, we welcome the statutory duty in s55 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 for immigration functions to be carried out with regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the UK.  We also welcome the closure of the removal centre to children, although we note that children are still detained while awaiting deportation/removal at Pease Pottage and Tinsley House and on arrival at ports in short term holding facilities.   Recommendation 10: Consider going beyond current legislation to protect children from violence and ban corporal punishment also in the private   4.3 Corporal punishment of children in England remains lawful in the home and in private foster care: parents/carers provided that the level of violence is not sufficient to amount to the offences of actual or grievous bodily harm or to child cruelty. The CRC has repeatedly recommended the outlawing of corporal punishment against children, most recently in its 2008 Concluding Observations on the UK.   We recommend nce is repealed to offer children the same protection from violence as adults.   Recommendation 11: Provide further information with regard to efforts to reduce poverty among children by half by 2010.  4.4 The commitment to reduce child poverty by half by 2010 has not been achieved. In addition, a recent report suggests that instead of meeting the 2020 target to eradicate child poverty, the likely outcome is that child poverty in 2020 will be higher than at present.9                                                9 Institute for Fiscal Studies, Child and Working Age Poverty from 2010 to 2020, IFS Commentary C121, October 2011.            OCC submission to the Universal Periodic Review 13th session 2012  United Kingdom         7  4.5 have recently highlighted their concern reforms on the number of children living in poverty. Their report made a number of recommendations including the need for the Child Poverty Act 2010 to be fully implemented.10  Further, recent social security reforms including the Welfare Reform Bill currently before Parliament have the potential to drive more children into poverty. The passage of this Bill without due reference to its impact on crights provides further evidence of the need for Child Rights Impact Assessments (see paragraph 3.4 above).   4.6 Insufficient financial resources have been dedicated to tackling child poverty across the UK.  We recommend that additional financial resources be allocated to this goal, and clearly identified within government budgets to allow appropriate monitoring, and that child rights impact assessments be applied to new policies and programmes affecting child poverty.   Recommendation 18: (i) Address the high incarceration rate of children, and (ii) ensure that the privacy of children is protected and to put an end to the so-  4.7 There has been a reduction in recent years in both the number of children entering the youth justice system and being sentenced to custody, in England and Wales.11   However, we are disappointed that England and Wales still have one of the highest rates of child imprisonment in Western Europe.  We recommend that the Government act upon the significant body of evidence that demonstrates how contact with the formal criminal justice system and acquiring a criminal record has a -offending.12  We therefore recommend that the government implement the principle in Article 37 UNCRC that a child shall only ever be arrested or put in prison as a last resort and for the shortest possible time.   4.8 Children in trouble with the law in England and Wales are still not guaranteed privacy at all stages of criminal proceedings, as required by Article 40(2)(v) UNCRC.  In the youth courts, where most criminal cases against children take place, reporting restrictions can be lifted by the court following convictChildren tried for serious offences in the adult Crown Court are not granted anonymity unless the judge makes an order to that effect.  Extensive and damaging media reporting including photographs of children frequently follows their identification. Following the extensive public disorder in England in August 2011, guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service was issued                                             10 ners Mid Term report to the State Party on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (November 2011)  http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/content/publications/content_542 11 Youth Justice Board (YJB), Youth Justice Annual Workload Data 2009/10, 2011, D126.  12 See Prison Reform Trust/Out of Trouble (2011), Reducing Child Imprisonment conference papers, www.outoftrouble.org.uk/learn/library/publications/reducing-child-imprisonment-conference.

We are extremely concerned at the effect that the identification of children in trouble with the law may have on their safety and life chances. We recommend that the government prohibit the reporting of details that may identify any child involved in criminal proceedings at any stage of those proceedings.    4.9 Pain-inflicting restraint techniques remain in use in the juvenile secure estate in England and Wales despite the risk of serious injury and danger to children.13  We recommend that the law and institutional rules should provide that, in    Further, in we recommend that the -pain-compliant methods of restraint be used, as a last resort and proportionately when necessary to prevent injury to the child or others.           5. Area of special concern  mental health  5.1 We wish to highlight an area of special concern that is not addressed in the recommendations to the UK from the 2008 UPR session, relating to the mental health of children and young people.  Work by OCC in 2010 including a programme of visits and interviews with children found that there is a lack of consistency and wide variation in the support for children in the youth justice system and in particular, in juvenile detention, to maintain good mental health as required by, inter alia, Article 24 UNCRC. 14 This includes practices such as the inappropriate use of strip searching and segregation/solitary confinement, the lack of an efficient and effective health screening process for all children entering custody, the use of prison-style accommodation for most children in custody (Young Offenders information sharing between public authorities regarding children in the system.   5.2 In particular, the inappropriate use of strip searching and segregation/solitary confinement is likely to violate the right to freedom from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as guaranteed by Article 37 UNCRC and other instruments.15  While there is widespread variation in practice across the juvenile                                             13 See  hospital treatment in private Secure Training Centres so far in 2011, and 61 in 2010.  14 people in the youth justice system, June 2011.

We believe that the use of solitary confinement and bare cells for children constitutes cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and recommend that they be absolutely prohibited.   5.3 In relation to in-patient mental health treatment, work by OCC investigating the experiences of children accommodated on adult mental health wards where they were unsafe and received poor levels of care17 resulted in the Department of e inappropriate admission of children to adult wards by April 2010.18    OCC November 2011                                             16 E.g. 73 days and 68 days: HM Prisons Inspectorate, Report on an announced inspection of HMYOI Hindley, 19-23 October 2009.    17 OCC, , Jan 2007.  18 , OCC website, and OCC, Out of the Shadows?

52,ODVV - Organization for Defending Victims of Violence,"Organization for Defending Victims of Violence (ODVV)  UPR Submission United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland June 2012 Compiled by:  Mohammad-Javad Javid & Esmat Shahmoradi About ODVV 1. The Organization for Defending Victims of Violence (ODVV) is a non-governmental, non-profit, non-partisan organization in Special Consultative Status to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC). The ODVV was established in 1988 in Tehran and has been active in the field of human rights and humanitarian activities. 2. The ODVV is also associated to the United Nations Department of Public Information (UNDPI), a participatory of the NGOs Coalition for an International Court (based in New York), and national coordinator of the Global March Against Child Labour (based in New Delhi) which cooperated in a variety of issues with international organizations and has working relations with many NGOs in Iran and around the globe. 3. The ODVV is also a member of the International Organization against Small and Light Weapons, and the UN Conference of Non-Governmental Organizations (CONGO), and the International Movement for a Just World (JUST), AMAN Network of Rehabilitation Centres in the Middle East and North Africa, International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT). 4. During the last 2 decades, we have done so many activities, mainly informative with regard to human rights and supportive of the victims of violence. Various human rights education courses, workshops, seminars, conferences have been held or co-held by the ODVV for various sectors of society: civil society institutions and governmental organizations. 5. Other Activities: - Participation in UN Commission on Human Rights annual sessions, and the new Human Rights Council sessions in Geneva. Written and oral statements on various items of the agenda are issued by the ODVV.  - Internship for foreign students  - Publication of different books and booklets on human rights such as Rights of the Child, Racism, Racial Discrimination and Xenophobia. Publication of Defenders Newsletter (English), human rights news and developments bulletin (Farsi), Rights of the Child bulletin (Farsi) - Daily electronic human rights newsletter in English and Farsi.  6. The present document is the individual submission of the Organization for Defending Victims of Violence (ODVV) for the Universal Periodic Review of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The submission focuses on Human Trafficking, Minority Rights and Islamophobia, Human Rights Violations and Crimes by UK Armed Forces in Iraq, and Violation of human rights following the UK riots. It also provides recommendations the UK should adopt in its promotion of human rights. ODVV commends the UK for supporting a majority of recommendations and welcomes its commitment to provide this Council with a progress report on the challenges identified in the present submission. ODVV notes that the challenges identified and recommendations offered are meant to serve as starting points for the interactive dialogue at next year UPR and are by no means exhaustive. Human Trafficking in the UK 7. Human Trafficking is the fastest growing criminal activity in the world.  The United Kingdom is a destination and, to a lesser extent, transit country for women, children, and men trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. Some victims, including minors from the UK, are also trafficked within the country. Migrant workers are trafficked to the UK for forced labor in agriculture, construction, food processing, domestic servitude, and food service. Some official figures come from the UK Human Trafficking Centre, part of the Serious Organized Crime Agency. It says that in the two years until the end of March 2011, it received 1,481 reports of suspected trafficking. The top three nationalities of victims were Nigerian, Chinese and Vietnamese. British citizens were also in the top 10.  Women made up almost three quarters of the suspected victims - and half of all the cases related to allegations of sexual exploitation. The other half all related to forced labor. Anti-Slavery International, a charity, says its best guess is that there are 5,000 people in some form of forced labor in the UK. 8. British police estimate that up to 4,000 human trafficking victims, mostly women, are being exploited in the UK at any given time. Law enforcement operations increasingly reveal a large percentage of the trafficking problem in the UK occurs hidden in residential areas throughout the country. While the government continued to provide care for adult women trafficked for sexual exploitation, not all identified trafficking victims received necessary care and protection. Conditions are that victims must be over 18; involved in prostitution within 3 months of referral; willing to cooperate in the prosecution of their traffickers; and must have been trafficked into the UK from abroad.  9. Complex international operations are moving people across continents. A family in south-east Asia could pay up to £40,000 to get a family member into Western Europe, believing that they will be able to send back riches. But that individual will often find themselves paying back a vast debt to the gang - with threats against the family back home if they do not comply.  10. While the UK government stipulates that victims are not inappropriately incarcerated, fined or penalized for unlawful acts as a direct result of being trafficked, some victims reportedly have been charged and prosecuted for immigration offences. One victim who managed to escape from her trafficker during the reporting period was repeatedly imprisoned on immigration violations, according to media sources. The UK provides foreign victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they face hardship or retribution. This process continues to be cumbersome and inconsistent for victims seeking such alternatives. By filing asylum,  humanitarian protection or extraordinary relief claims on a case-by-case basis, such victims may obtain residency. 11. In the business of slavery, there are cases of child human trafficking, within the UK, where victims have been rescued from slavery only to go missing from UK care systems. It is believed that in such cases victims are tracked down by their traffickers and rarely resurface.  12. A recently release report compiled by the NSPCC NI and Barnardos NI suggests that Northern Ireland is being used by human traffickers as a gateway to both Britain and the Republic of Ireland. The report states; ""There is evidence that human traffickers are using Belfast International Airport as a port of entry to the UK and some media reports state that Northern Ireland has been identified as a key gateway for criminal gangs involved in people trafficking to the Republic of Ireland 13. . The government has signed up to international conventions against trafficking, and published its own national strategy. ODVV urges the United Kingdom to continue to address this issue. Some measures as temporary residence permits have been taken by the UK government, which are granted on the condition that the victims cooperate with law enforcement authorities. ODVV further urges the UK government to provide a report of the taaction plan around violence against women and girls, and explain the type of help, legal redress and compensation that is available to them. Minority Rights and Islamophobia 14. The term Minority Rights embodies two separate concepts: first, normal individual rights as applied to members of racial, ethnic, class, religious, linguistic or sexual minorities, and second, collective rights accorded to minority groups. The term may also apply simply to individual rights of anyone who is not part of a majority decision. The United Kingdom has had racism, from medieval times, through years of the slave trade to the modern day.  15. Recent years have witnessed incidents of hatred or irrational fear of Islam and Muslims. Islamophobia has lead to the practice of discrimination against Muslims by excluding them from the economic, social, and public life of the nation. It includes the perception that Islam has no values in common with other cultures, is inferior to the West and is a violent political ideology rather than a religion.  16. A perceived trend of Islamophobia over the last few months has been recognized by the Organization for Defending Victims of Violence. Particularly, ignorance of governments to pay more attention to this form of intolerance is the ruling sentiment across nations with Muslim minorities. In the UK, the Barnabas Fund began campaigning, in August 2011, against what it said was the growing ""Islamisation"" of Britain.  17. When accused of terrorism, Muslims in the UK are Muslims; when killed by looters, they become Asian. Muslims in this country bravely defended shops and communities during riots in August 2011. Their example of outstanding civic duty in support of neighbors is worth highlighting- especially when sections of the UK media are so quick to print negative headlines about Muslims on the flimsiest of pretexts. According to the surveys, British people are most likely to blame the media for Islamophobia in the UK.  18. In January 2010, a report from the University of Exeter's European Muslim research centre noted that the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes has increased, ranging from ""death threats and murder to persistent low-level assaults, such as spitting and name-calling,"" for which the media and politicians have been blamed with fueling anti-Muslim hatred. The Islamophobic incidents it described include: ""Neil Lewington, a violent extremist nationalist convicted in July 2009 of a bomb plot; Terence Gavan, a violent extremist nationalist convicted in January 2010 of manufacturing nail bombs and other explosives, firearms and weapons; a gang attack in November 2009 on Muslim students at City University; the murder in September 2009 of Muslim pensioner, Ikram Syed ul-Haq; a serious assault in August 2007 on the Imam at London Central Mosque; and an arson attack in June 2009 on Greenwich Islamic Centre."" Other Islamophobic incidents include ""Yasir, a young Moroccan,"" being ""nearly killed while waiting to take a bus from Willesden to Regent's Park in London"" and ""left in a coma for three months""; ""Mohammed Kohelee,"" a ""caretaker who suffered burns to his body while trying to prevent an arson attack against Greenwich Mosque""; ""the murder"" of ""Tooting pensioner Ekram Haque"" who ""was brutally beaten to death in front of his three year old granddaughter"" by a ""race-hate"" gang; and ""police officers"" being injured ""during an English Defence League (EDL) march in Stoke."" 19. While the focus of contemporary counter-terrorism policy remains fixed on rooting out extreme ideas, it encourages the public to treat Muslims as potential 'suspects' or legitimate objects of abuse. Internet crusaders target all Muslims, not just extremists.   UK armed forces in Iraq  20. Reports show that an estimated 30,000 detainees are held without trial in Iraq, many of whom are instances of enforced disappearance. Thousands of these detainees continue to be detained despite judicial orders issued for their release. There are also reports illustrating the UK involvement in the mistreatment of detainees held abroad. 21. What happened to Baha Mousa and the other detainees at the hands of British soldiers was a clear instance of human rights crimes by the UK armed forces in Iraq. Senior officers should have been aware of the abuse Mousa was enduring. Mousa and his fellow detainees endured repeated beatings and hooding. Hooding is one of the ""five techniques"" that the British government said 40 years ago it would never use again and is prohibited by the Geneva conventions. There has been gross failure of the senior officers, who allowed the ill-treatment of the men to continue, to provide clear and consistent guidelines about the proper treatment of detainees. The killing of Baha Mousa illustrates some key problems with military detention, among which is the general lawlessness around detention by the British army. By denying that international human rights law applied to the British army, the then government authorised British forces to detain Iraqis when they wanted, for almost any reason, and for as long as they wanted. The government denied there was any requirement to bring all detainees in British custody before a judge, a critical step to ensure the legality of detention and avoid abuse. 22. The need for full and public disclosure of the truth about human rights violations and the duty of states to hold those responsible to account remains essential and must not be swept aside. The UK torture inquiry should not be secretive and flawed. Reports, however, say that the government does not intend to provide transparency and the inquiry is supposed to be highly  secretive, with much of the proceedings held behind closed doors and any new disclosures requiring the government's approval.  23. Media reports said the government decided to make the payments in order to avoid possible disclosures about the activities of the intelligence services in court cases involving by former detainees.  To date the rights to access to justice for these former detainees have been obstructed by persistent efforts on the part of the UK government to prevent disclosure of evidence relevant to these allegations.  Violation of human rights following the UK riots 24. Following the riots over the recent months, which resulted in the spreading of the unrest to other parts of the capital, and other British cities, the behaviour of the British Government, particularly the violent treatment of the detainees, mass arrests, and the handing down of heavy sentences to the criminals in the riots, violation of fair trial standards, blatant violation of freedom of expression and information, and inattention to poverty and social-economic discriminations as the root cause of these protests are all clear cases of blatant and grave violations of human rights in the country.   Recommendations  25. ODVV calls on the UK to ensure that effective measures are in place to allow for quick and accurate identification of trafficked victims, drawing attention to incidents where victims have been identified as irregular migrants. In such cases, victims are often deported and therefore unable to seek redress. When a safe return to the country of origin was not guaranteed victims must be offered temporary or permanent residence permits. 26. ODVV urges the UK government to ensure that adequate procedures are in place to enable quick and accurate identification of trafficked persons to prevent any misidentification of trafficked persons as irregular migrants, which often leads to detention and deportation, effectively precluding a chance to seek compensation. 27. United Kingdom should ensure that trafficked persons are equipped with access to information, free legal aid and other necessary assistance such as interpretation services, and regular residence status during the duration of any legal proceedings. 28. It is feared that the London 2012 Games could become a magnet for prostitutes trafficked from Eastern Europe by criminal gangs. ODVV believes that these issues need to be addressed as a matter of urgency, and that working with other countries to combat human trafficking will be key to help respond quickly and appropriately to any potential increased risk of trafficking. 29. ODVV calls for the UK Government to introduce general anti-discrimination laws. Future policies must ensure they do not undermine the trust Muslim communities have in state institutions nor their sense of belonging in Britain. 30. societies have a crucial role to play in helping to dispel myths about Muslim communities. There  is a common misconception that Islam is a religion of Violence. There is no basis for this in Islam. Islam is a religion of peace. Accordingly, ODVV invites nations to improve understanding among all Abrahamic faiths and cultures and avoid incitement to hatred and violence, in order to reach a world of peace and security. 31. Recommendations on human rights violations and by UK armed forces in Iraq 32. UK authorities must deliver justice over abuse cases in Iraq; payment is only a part of the remedy to the victims. 33. UK must comply with Geneva Conventions on torture.  34. An inquiry into allegations of human rights crimes and the respective legal proceedings should be accompanied with sufficient transparency. 35. The United Kingdom should urgently ensure a full, transparent and credible accounting of the circumstances in these and other cases.  36. We urge the United Kingdom to continue to remain committed to its national, regional and international commitments: i.e. not to abolish the Human Rights Act, nor withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights. 37. We urge the British Government to investigate the behaviour of the police in the recent riots in the country, and take steps to ensure this kind of behaviour is not repeated.

INTRODUCTION  1. The Odysseus Trust makes this submission under sections B, C and D as set out in the General Guidelines for the Preparation of Information under the Universal Periodic Review.1   2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  2. This submission focuses on developments in the law on freedom of expression under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the ICCPR).  3. libel have been abolished and the freedom of information legislation has been modified. Reform of the civil law on defamation is currently underway, the Government is consulting on the possible removal of use of injunctions to restrict free speech.   3. SECTION B: THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK  4. The United Kingdom has ratified several international human rights treaties, including the ICCPR and the European Convention on Human Rights (the ECHR).  5. The UKs constitution is contained both in written law (legislation) and unwritten law (the principles of the common law and equity declared by the courts). The courts recognise some Acts as of particular constitutional importance, so that they may be amended or repealed only expressly or by necessary implication.2 Both the European Communities Act 1972 (the ECA) and the Human Rights Act 1998 (the HRA) are constitutional acts in this sense. The HRA gives legal effect the ECHR rights and freedoms. It requires the courts to read all legislation, as far as is possible, so as to be compatible with the ECHR and, where this is not possible, empowers the courts to make a declaration of incompatibility. The ECA requires the courts to give direct effect to the supremacy of EU law, and, where necessary, to displace inconsistent legislative provisions.  6. Article 10(1) ECHR provides a right to freedom of expression and to receive and impart information and ideas. Article 10(2) ECHR allows the exercise of Article 10(1) ECHR to be limited by such formalities,                                                  1 Contained in Human Rights Council Decision 6/102, Follow-up to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, section I adopted 27 September 2007, viewed at: http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/decisions/A_HRC_DEC_6_102.pdf  2 Toburn v Sunderland City Council  [2002] EWHC 195 (Admin), para. 62   2 conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.  7. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter) was given effect equal to the Treaties by Article 6(1) Treaty on European Union that came into force on 1 December 2009. Article 11 of the Charter provides for the right to freedom of expression and the right to information. Article 52(3) states that the rights set out in the Charter build on the rights set out in the ECHR. The UK negotiated a Protocol, Protocol 30, to the Treaty which states that the Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice of the European Union to find that acts of the UK are contrary to the rights set out in the Charter. The effect of this Protocol is one of the issues for determination by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-411/10.3  8. Prior to the entry into force of the HRA, freedom of expression was protected mainly by the common law but not as a positive right subject only to necessary and proportionate exceptions. There was no general right to information other than the right to view information put into the public domain in accordance with the thirty year rule under which official records were deposited with the National Archives and available for public inspection after thirty years. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the FOIA) created a public right of access to official information, subject to various exceptions.   4. SECTION C: CHANGES AND REFORM OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION  9. Recent changes to freedom of speech in the UK are that the common law offences of blasphemous, seditious, obscene and criminal libel have been abolished (4.1) and the freedom of information legislation has been modified (4.2). Ongoing developments include reform of the civil law on defamation (4.3), the Government consultation on the possible  from the Public Order Act 1986 (4.4) and Parliament taking evidence on the law of privacy and the use of injunctions to restrict free speech (4.5).  4.1 Abolition of Common Law Speech Offences  10. The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were abolished by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 in England and Wales.4 Both offences still exist in Northern Ireland where Justice and Policing is devolved to the Northern Irish Assembly. Parliament has also abolished the common law offences of sedition and seditious libel; defamatory libel and obscene libel in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.5  11. Blasphemous libel is to be distinguished from the offence of incitement to religious hatred since it protected only the tenets of the Church of England whereas the statutory offence protects people of all religions and none against words or behaviour which are intentionally threatening, and freedom of expression is expressly protected in the legislation. The last successful prosecution for blasphemous libel was in the Gay News case in 1979 where the publishers of the Gay News, Gay News Ltd and Dennis Lemon, were fined £1,000 and                                                  3 Case C-411/10 N. S. v Secretary of State for the Home Department 4 Section 79, Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (2008 c. 4):  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/79  5 Section 73, Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (2009 c. 25): http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/73    3 £500 respectively and Mr Lemon was sentenced to a nine month suspended sentence.6 In 2004, the Court rejected a private prosecution of the BBC attempted by Christian Voice over Jerry Springer: The Opera.7  4.2 Changes to Freedom of Information   12. The FOIA was amended by the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010.8 Section 45 reduces the period after which documents must be transferred to the Public Records Office, and are thereby put into the public domain, to 20 years. This provision has not yet been brought into force although the Government are committed to doing so in this Parliament.9  13. The Protection of Freedoms Bill seeks to extend the FOIA to companies owned by two or more public bodies and will create a right to data covering datasets held by Government and local authorities. The datasets will have to be provided in a reusable format.10  14. Secondary legislation currently before Parliament extends the provisions of the FOIA to the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Financial Ombudsman Service and the University and Colleges Admissions Service.11  15. Communications with the Sovereign, heir to the Throne and second in line to the Throne are wholly exempt from the right to freedom of information i.e. the public interest in disclosure can no longer outweigh the public interest in not disclosing.12.  4.3 Defamation Reform  16. There is widespread recognition that the current civil law on defamation is being used to chill freedom of expression unnecessarily.  17. Several high profile cases have indicated that large corporations and institutions use the law on defamation to prevent what may be legitimate criticism.13 There is evidence that the mere threat of libel litigation, and the costs associated, is having a chilling effect on freedom of expression.14 There is also limited anecdotal evidence indicating that British courts are being used by individuals with little or no connection to the UK to obtain redress for harm done to their reputations outside the UK by words published outside of the UK (libel tourism).  18. On 26 May 2010 Lord Lester of Herne Hill QC introduced his Private Members Bill to reform of the law.15 The Bill was designed to make defending a defamation claim easier and less costly without altering the                                                  6 Whitehouse v Lemon [1979] A.C. 617 7  [2007] EWHC 2785 (Admin) 8 Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (2010 c. 25), Part 6: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/part/6  9 Ministry of Justice, Opening up public bodies to public scrutiny, 7 January 2011: http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/press-releases/moj/press-release-070111a.htm  10 Protection of Freedoms Bill, Part 6: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2010-2012/0099/2012099.pdf  11 Freedom of Information (Designation as Public Authorities) Order 2011: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2011/9780111514962/contents  12 Section 2(3), Freedom of Information Act 2000, as amended: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/schedule/7  13 For example, the McLibel case ( [1999] EWCA Civ 1144) and British Chiropractic Association v Dr Singh [2010] EWCA Civ 350 14 See, for example, Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Limited and others [1992] UKHL 6, at 548D-E, per Lord Keith of Kinkel; Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd and Others [1999] UKHL 45, at 192H, per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, and at 201, per Lord Steyn; and British Chiropractic Association v Dr Singh [2010] EWCA Civ 350, at para. 11, per Lord Judge, LCJ 15 See Appendix 1.   4 fundamental basis of the tort of defamation, but striking a fair balance between freedom of expression and the right to reputation. The Government responded by publishing its own draft Bill on defamation reform for public consultation on 15 March 2011.16  19. The consultation occurred alongside the scrutiny of the Governments draft Bill by a committee of MPs and Peers, the Joint Committee on the Draft Defamation Bill. On 19 October 2011, the Joint Committee published their report on the Draft Defamation Bill.17  20. The Government is committed to prepare a Bill for consideration by Parliament in the new session.  4.4 Public Order Act 1986  21. The Government is currently consulting on police powers for public order.18 As part of that consultation, the Government is examining the continued relevance of section 5 Public Order Act 1986.19  22. Section 5(1) Public Order Act 1986 provides:  (1) A person is guilty of an offence if he  (a) uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or (b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting,  within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby.  23. The offence is tried by a magistrate who can impose a fine up to £1,000.  24. The section 5(1) offence is to be distinguished from section 4A which criminalises the same threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour which intends to harass, alarm or distress a person. There is no proposal to change the section 4A offence.  25. The Joint Committee on Human Rights20 has consistently argued that, while the criminalisation of threatening and abusive speech may be proportionate, the criminalisation of insulting words, behaviour, signs or representations which do not intend to cause distress is a disproportionate infringement of the right to freedom of expression.  4.5 Privacy and Injunctions  26. Following the well-publicised use of interim injunctions in cases where newspapers have sought to publish the details of the private lives of some well-known individuals,21 the Government requested that Parliament take evidence on the use of injunctions to protect the right to privacy enshrined at Article 8(1) ECHR.22 The                                                  16 Ministry of Justice, Draft Defamation Bill: http://www.justice.gov.uk/consultations/365.htm  17 Joint Committee on the Draft Defamation Bill, First Report, HL Paper 203, HC 930I:  http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdefam/203/20302.htm  18 http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/consultations/police-powers/  19 Public Order Act 1986 (1986 c.64): http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/contents  20 Seventh Report of 2008-2009 Session, Demonstrating respect for rights?

The Master of the Rolls has also issued a report on the use of injunctions in privacy cases25 which gave a practice direction for judges hearing privacy cases and set up a pilot study collecting data on the use of injunctions in privacy cases and the use of anonymised judgments.  28. The European Court of Human Rights has held that Article 8(1) ECHR does not impose on newspapers the requirement to notify an individual prior to the publication of a report about them.26   5. SECTION D: RECOMMENDATIONS  29. The Government should , in particular General Comment 34,27 and the ECHR by introducing legislation to:   extend the public right of access to official information under the FOIA in accordance with paragraphs 18 & 19 of General Comment 34;  give effect to the recommendations of the Joint Committee to reform defamation law in accordance with paragraph 47 of General Comment 34; and  remove insulting from section 5(1) Public Order Act 1986 in accordance with paragraph 22 of General Comment 34.  30. However, the Government should await the outcome of the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions enquiries and the results of the implementation of the Master of the Rolls practice direction and pilot study on data collection, before drawing any conclusions as to reform of the law on privacy.                                                  http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110523/debtext/110523-0001.htm#1105237000004  23 Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions Terms of Reference: http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/privacy-and-superinjunctions/role/  24 See Appendix 2 for Lord Lester's evidence to the Joint Committee. 25 Master of the Rolls, Report of the Committee on Super-Injunctions: Super-Injunctions, Anonymised Injunctions and Open Justice, May 2011, available at: http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Reports/super-injunction-report-20052011.pdf  26 Case of Mosley v.

54,PEN - English Centre of PEN,"  Universal Periodic Review English PEN Submission to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Free Expression in the United Kingdom   Introduction 1. PEN International is a worldwide fellowship of writers, promoting literature and freedom of expression.  Established in 1921, PEN is one of the oldest human rights organisations in the world, and has observer status at UNESCO and ECOSOC.  There are 140 Centres in 101 countries.  2. English PEN is the founding centre of PEN International.  The organisation is a registered charity in England & Wales (number 1125610).  Through its programmes, campaigns and research, English PEN promotes the freedom to write and the freedom to read in the UK and internationally.    3. in concerns regarding the right to free expression in the United Kingdom, as guaranteed by Article 19 of the ICCPR, Article 10 of the ECHR, and Article 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Libel 4. The UN Human Rights Committee Report 2008 on the United Kingdom1, published on 30 July 2008, raised significant concerns regarding the law of libel:  reporting on matters of serious public interest, adversely affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work...  5. Since this report was published, a number of high profile libel cases have reinforced the findings of the UNHRC.  The cases of the British Chiropractic Association vs Dr Simon Singh2, and NMT vs Dr Peter Wilmshurst are the best known examples where defendants had had their scientific criticisms vindicated by the courts, only after lengthy and costly court battles.  A recent survey of members conducted by the Publishers Association,3 demonstrates how the current legal framework has imposed a culture of self-censorship on publishers.   All publishers surveyed had modified content or language before publication;  40% of publishers had withdrawn a publication as a result of threatened libel actions;  A third had refused work from authors for fear of libel claims;  A third avoid publishing on particular subjects; and 60% of publishers avoid writing about particular companies or individuals who have previously sued for libel.                                                             1 http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/hrcs93.htm 2 Case reference [2010] EWCA Civ 350; [2011] EMLR 1 3 The Publishers Association reveals enforced censorship in books due to libel   6. It is clear from these statistics and the emblematic cases mentioned that the current libel laws in England & Wales continue to significantly chill free expression and discourage legitimate investigative reporting in the public interest.  7. Following the launch of Libel Reform Campaign led by English PEN, Index on Censorship and Sense About Science, the British Government has acknowledged the threat to freedom of expression posed by outdated libel laws.  Manifesto commitments by all three political parties in advance of the 2010 General Election resulted in the publication of a consultation and draft Defamation Bill on 15 March 2010.4  However, the published draft Bill contains insufficient protections for free expression.  A report by the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on the Draft Defamation Bill   ... the changes to the defences available against libel claims, while welcome, do not always achieve the clarification sought.  For a Bill that is overdue, the Government's current draft may be thought modest. It does not, in some important respects, strike a fair balance between the protection of reputation and freedom of speech.5  8.           Provide better protections for secondary publishers (for example, booksellers and ISPs) against libel threats;  and peer-reviewed articles appearing in journals; and   A court--judicial censorship by threats to ISPs and web-hosts.  9. The Committee also recommended procedural changes to the way court cases are managed, to reduce costs and improve access to justice.  10. English PEN broadly agrees with the Joint Selec, through the Libel Reform Campaign, has offered further recommendations.  These include:   A limit on the ability of corporations to sue for libel; and    11. If the draft Bill is not amended before it is brought to Parliament (early 2012) then a new law of Defamation will not sufficiently protect freedom of expression, and will still journalists, publishers and scientists will remain vulnerable to censorship through litigation,                                                             4 http://www.justice.gov.uk/consultations/draft-defamation-bill.htm 5 Joint Committee on the Draft Defamation Bill  First Report, 12 October 2011 http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdefam/203/20302.htm    12. In 2007, Samina Malik was found guilty under the Terrorism Act 2000 of possessing material likely to be of use to a terrorist.  She had written poems in which she fantasised   13. t the Court of Appeal in June 2008.  14. Whilst English PEN about the implications of her prosecution.  In the absence of involvement in any actual plot or conspiracy, the implication is that a person may be dragged through the Justice System, and possibly convicted, for   The Ministry of Justice must provide proper guidance to the Crown Prosecution Service and the Courts on Section 58 of the Terrorism Act, to ensure that there are no future prosecutions based on the reading or writing of propagandist material, however distasteful that material might be to the general public. Twitter Joke 15. In 2010, 27 year old Paul Chambers was convicted of  for posting the following tweet:  Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!!  16. Chambers was not convicted under Terrorism legislation, but under laws meant to discourage nuisance callers.  He is appealing his conviction in the High Court.    17. English PEN is concerned at the precedent set by this prosecution, which applies laws formulated in the 1930s to twenty-first century world of digital technology and social media.  The context which it was made, was not taken into account by Magistrates during the trial.    18. After the riots in many UK cities in August 2011, there were calls from politicians, including the Prime Minister, for tougher laws to proscribe speech on Twitter and other social networking sites, so the precedent set by the Chambers case has clear implications for the future.  19. Guidance on these matters must be given to local prosecutors, to ensure that the UK does not face a growing number of small prosecutions and convictions for short messages posted online  the United Kingdom.  20.  Incitement to Racial and Religious Hatred  21. The 2008 Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (23 May 2008) good example by other countries:  20. That the example of the United Kingdom in issuing, in principle, a specific law dealing with incitement to racial and religious hatred, be emulated as a good practice in countries which have not done so, in implementation of article 20(2) of ICCPR and its stipulated purpose.  22. English PEN applauds this recommendation by the Working Group.  In particular, we draw in particular, paragraph 29J6:  Protection of freedom of expression Nothing in this Part shall be read or given effect in a way which prohibits or restricts discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult or abuse of particular religions or the beliefs or practices of their adherents, or of any other belief system or the beliefs or practices of its adherents, or proselytising or urging adherents of a different religion or belief system to cease practising their religion or belief system.  23. We note that some draft laws to proscribe incitement to religious hatred are drawn so wide, as to include legitimate political, satirical, literary or theological discussion of religion.  This effectively criminalises blasphemy and any criticism of religion, which is contrary to the principles of Freedom of Expression.  The clause above, present in the United KiRacial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, is essential to the proper protection of freedom of expression.  The UN Human Rights Council should draw attention to this clause when citing    The Human Rights Act 1998  24. Like many Human Rights organisation in the UK (and in particular, the British Institute of Human Rights), English PEN is seriously concerned about the lack of strong political leadership on human rights, and the patchy advocacy for the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) among elected politicians.    25. We join the BIHR in urging the UN Human Rights Council to recognising the constitutional Commission examining a Act.                                                             6

The Poppy Project, established in 2002, is the largest independently funded service in the UK which delivers support and/or accommodation to female victims of trafficking. We have, to date, received over 2000 referrals all of whom were trafficked into and exploited in the UK. Access to the project is dependent on a woman meeting certain criteria based on the international definition of trafficking.  The Poppy Project supports women over the age of 16 who have been trafficked into or within the UK and who have experienced exploitation as a result of their trafficking situation. Exploitation can include sexual exploitation and prostitution, forced labour including domestic slavery, organ harvesting, forced illicit activities or other forms of exploitation as identified by Poppy.  UK trafficking responses in context  2. There is no free-standing legal framework for the recognition or protection victims of trafficking in the UK. The National Referral Mechanism, introduced by the UK Government in April 2009 to identify victims of trafficking, is a creature of policy, not statute. Prior to the entry into force of the Palermo Protocol (ratified by the UK in 2006) and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (ratified by the UK December 2008, implementation effective from 1 April 2009) there was no primary legislation, or other legislation, which declared THB as human rights violation, albeit human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation or labour exploitation constituted criminal acts under various pieces of UK criminal legislation. This position has not changed following the entry into force of either treaty. No legislation has been introduced by the UK by that would recognise THB is a human rights violation.  3. The UK is bound, as State Party and as a member of the Council of Europe, to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, including the non-derogable rights under Articles 3 and 4. Hence, subsequent to the ECtHR judgment in Rantsev v Cyprus and Russia (7 January 2010) THB is now considered as a human rights violation in the UK, but this arises directly in consequence of the Rantsev judgment (as of course whilst the ECtHR in Siliadin in 2005 determined that domestic servitude constituted forced labour, that case was not assessed in light of its clearly trafficking background).   4. In the context of the positive obligations on States under Articles 3 and 4 ECHR to operate effective, procedural measures to protect victims of trafficking, including by way of the criminal investigation of their traffickers, Rantsev was recently applied, approved and followed by the High Court in the case of OOO & Ors v The Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2011] EWHC 1246 (QB) (20 May 2011)    http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2011/1246.html In that case, the High Court found that the Metropolitan police had failed to investigate the claims of four victims of trafficking from Nigeria who had been trafficked to the UK as children and had each been exploited for forced labour (domestic servitude) and awarded each of the victims £5000 in damages against the police for failing to comply with their positive obligations to investigate under Articles 3 and 4 ECHR.   The UK legislative framework 5. In 2003 the Sexual Offences Act introduced the crime of Trafficking into (within, or out of) the UK for sexual exploitation,i a clumsily-worded offence that requires that a person is moved into, within or out of the UK for the purposes of exploitation and that the exploitation consists, at a minimum, of the commission of another relevant sexual offence listed in the Act, such as rape, sexual assault or exploitation in prostitution.  6. In 2004 the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Act introduced a new offence of Trafficking people for exploitation,ii which creates an offence if and only if someone has been moved into, within or out of the UK, for the intention of exploitation as defined in Article 4 of the European Court of Human Rights, and it can   3 be demonstrated that the person was subject to force, fraud or deception  the other means indicated in the international definition of trafficking (coercion, exploitation of a position of vulnerability or the giving of gifts to secure consent) do not meet the threshold. As of the latest available official statistics, published in December 2010, 28 defendants had been proceeded against under the Act, with only 16 (57%) found guilty.iii   Formalising identification  7. To assist all states parties with implementation the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) developed the concept of a centralised National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a tool that was designed to ensure states could be compliant with the identification and victim care obligations in the Convention. A handbook on NRMs was published in 2004, and intending to reflect the multi-agency approach that the OSCE felt would necessarily underpin any effective system, it was iv  8. likely to encounter a potential victim of trafficking, such as police, immigration officials, specialist NGOs, and social services to make a detailed referral listing the assessment as to whether it is reasonable to believe that this person may be a victim. individual protection from removal and access to support arrangements (as detailed by Article 12 of ECAT)v which will allow them to reach a person is a victim of trafficking, and whether or not, owing to their circumstances, they should be issued with a residence permit to remain in the UK. The explanatory report of the Convention explains the envisaged role of these important decision makers: destroyed by the traffickers. In such cases they risk being treated primarily as illegal immigrants, prostitutes or illegal workers and being punished or returned to their countries without being given any help. To avoid that, Article 10(1) requires that Parties provide their competent authorities with persons who are trained and qualified in preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and in identifying and helping victims, including children and that they ensure that those authorities cooperate with one other as well as with relevant support organisations...It is essential that these have people capable of identifying victims and channelling them towards the organisations and services who can assist vi 9. It is clear that the Convention anticipated a cooperative identification process that is specifically designed to avoid misidentification of victims of trafficking as illegal immigrants, and that would ensure that qualified professionals, concerned with and able to respond to the complex needs of trafficked persons, would make these decisions.  10. In the UK, however, the decision making within the NRM has been divided into two competent authorities, divided along immigration status. For those who are UK or European nationals, decisions are made by the UK Human Trafficking Centre, which is part of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. UKHTC makes all decisions on cases of persons not subject to immigration control. Not only are these claims not contributing to UK immigration statistics, but it is important to note that positively identifying them does not create a financial obligation that otherwise would not exist. As nationals of EU states these individuals already have recourse to public funds.  11. There is no appeal process for any NRM decision, though some asylum decisions instruct those in receipt of negative NRM decisions to raise these issues when appealing an asylum refusal. Technically speaking, however, the only way to officially challenge a decision is via judicial review at the High Court. Judicial review is an   4 arduous and complex process and given a lack of understanding of the NRM amongst the judiciary it is rare that applications to the High Court are even accepted let alone successful. If that fails the only recourse is the European Court of Human Rights.  Discrimination in victim identification  12. Data regarding NRM decisions made for EU (but not UK) nationals from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011 shows that EU nationals were positively identified at the initial stage in 93.8% of cases, 85.5% of which were also positively identified at conclusive stage. For UK nationals the numbers are even higher, with 96.1% (of 52 cases) given positive decisions at initial stage and 91.8% of those given positive conclusive decisions.  13. It is very clear that positive decisions for non-EU nationals are significantly lower than that of EU and UK nationals. The average positive reasonable grounds rate for UK and EU nationals is 89.4%, compared to 61% for non-EU nationals. At conclusive grounds the comparison is even starker with an average of 82.8% of UK and EU nationals conclusively accepted to be victims while the average for non-EU nationals is only 45.9%. There is no evidence to suggest that UK or EU nationals present with more genuine claims than those of non-EU nationals, no greater likelihood of willingness to work with law enforcement or any other indicator, aside from not being subject to immigration control that sets those claims apart from those of non-EU nationals.   14. It is impossible to know exactly what percentage of non-EU nationals also claim asylum, but data collected by the Poppy Project suggests that it is possible that more than 90% of non-EU trafficked women are simultaneously seeking asylum.vii From 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011, 418 non-EU women with credible accounts of trafficking were referred to the Poppy Project. 181 of those women were able to provide information about their immigration status. Of those 181, 168 were either claiming asylum or had been refused. An additional seven women had not claimed asylum but expressed an intention to do so. Therefore of the 181 cases, 175 women, or 96.6% were also in the asylum system. The overwhelming majority of those claims are still outstanding, but longer-term data collected by Poppy suggests a refusal rate at initial decision of 75-80%. Of these, however, 89% are overturned at appeal and some form of leave is granted.viii.  Experiences and outcomes of trafficked persons claiming asylum 15. This is not merely a statistical problem. An overreliance on the asylum system to inform trafficking decision making has horrific consequences for the individuals involved. In the case of women who may have a claim for protection based on sexual exploitation the overlap between these two systems can be particularly damaging. The Poppy Project has collected several examples of cases where violence against women has been dealt with inappropriately in both systems. For example in the case of Ms A, a Nigerian national who claimed asylum and raised a trafficking claim in the NRM, the competent authority determined that her claim to have fallen prey to traffickers after fleeing sexual violence as a child was not accepted, and therefore her you were raped when you were 12 years old [as such] your father and family would not have been killed, and as a consequence of this your whole account of events has ix the UK had been identified and a police investigation was underway, yet because the basis of her asylum claim had not been found credible her entire trafficking account was refused.  16. Or take the case of Ms B, an Indian woman exploited in forced labour who also experienced sexual violence at the hands of her trafficker. Her NRM decision stated:   ighlighted numerous incidents of non-x    5 17. Thankfully her initial asylum refusal was overruled at appeal where the judge accepted her claim to be trafficked and raped, rendering the NRM refusal meaningless. 18. Ms C, an Albanian national, received a decision that stated she could not be believed xi in the brothels in which she were exploited  a detail established at her asylum interview which was used to refuse a trafficking claim.  19. Official UK Borders Agency guidance on assessing whether or not someone is a victim of trafficking states:  their case... interviewing officers should phrase their questions carefully and sympathetically, but should keep in mind the need to get as full an account as they can, while at the same time taking care not to cause undue distress...The first task is to assess the material facts of the asylum claim, giving appropriate weight to all the xii  20. Despite this guidance decisions are still issued which make statements such as: asylum interview. You do not remember where the house was located, you do not know the name of the man who helped you to escape, you do not remember the name of the train station you went to after escaping. Whilst it is noted that you were relatively new in this country when these events unfolded, it is considered that you would have some memory of such basic details given the significance of these events and their impact upon explanation is not accepted...Consequently your evidence about the alleged escape from your abductors is not accxiii 21. The decision quoted above has been accepted, in conjunction with another Poppy Project case, by the European Court of Human Rightsxiv ongoing attempts to remove her to the country from which she was trafficked give rise to potential Article 3 (protection from torture) and Article 4 (protection from slavery) violations. The acceptance of potential Article 4 violations is critical as slavery and servitude can be seen to have been raised via the NRM, not the asylum system, which could have allowed the ECHR to refuse to consider them as This case has been given priority by the court under Rule 41 and could set an extremely important precedent with regard to attempts to rely on the asylum system to remove victims of trafficking from the territory.   Recommendations:   Trafficking 1. The National Referral Mechanism must be reviewed and extricated from the asylum system to ensure that the system: a. is genuinely multi-agency, placing identification and support, not immigration status, at the centre of decision-making b. carries a right of appeal to an independent body, comprised of multi agency staff  c. Ensure that asylum decisions are not made by the same individuals who make NRM decisions  2. Publish guidance and provide training for first responders and decision-makers that effectively and accurately reflect the ECAT definition of trafficking and instruct those working with trafficked people on appropriate application thereof.  3. UKHTC and the UK Borders Agency must publish quarterly statistics that actively seek to understand any overlap occurring between the asylum and NRM systems. 4. one decision (i.e. overturning of a negative NRM decision) is reflected in any related asylum decision.    6 5. Appoint an independent anti-trafficking rapporteur to oversee identification, decision making, collaborative working and data collection. This office requires with statutory powers to request information from law enforcement, UKBA, social services, a dedicated function that works collaboratively with NGOs, and must be accountable to Parliament.  Asylum 1. UKBA must fulfil all obligations with regard to non-discrimination and equality to ensure that all individuals are able to benefit equally from the services they provide.  2. Ensure that female asylum applicants are provided with female case owners, who carry the case from beginning to end whenever possible, and that female interpreters are provided at all interviews. 3. Ensure that case owners making decisions on asylum claims in which trafficking have been raised: a. Understand the application of the Geneva Conventions, ECAT and other relevant documents with regard to gender and human trafficking   b. have a thorough understanding of relevant domestic policy and legislation and have access to specialist advisors within the agency  c. treat applicants with respect and dignity, conducting interviews with an appropriate regard for the trauma experienced  d. do not make assumptions, speculate about an indivprovide alternative theories where credibility is questioned  e. work with all involved support professionals regarding trafficking issues, including seeking input from law enforcement or prosecution where relevant.                                                    i Sexual Offences Act 2003.s.57-59, London: HMSO   ii Immigration and Asylum (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004.s4, London: HMSO.  iii  HC Hansard, Vol 520, Col 1178W, 21 December 2010.  iv Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, 2004.

56,RC - René Cassin,"  1  Universal Periodic Review Stakeholder Submission   Submission by   René Cassin, UK Main contact:   Simone Abel, Director, René Cassin  Address:   152 West End Lane, London, NW6 1SD, UK Tel: +44 7738388857 simone.abel@renecassin.org www.renecassin.org   2 Introduction  In this submission René Cassin seeks to assist the UN in assessing the UKperformance through the Universal Periodic Review (UPR).  In Section 1 we call upon the UN to seek a commitment from the UK Government that the Human Rights Act will be preserved and built upon in any efforts to develop the existing framework for human rights protection in the UK.  In Section 2 we analyse a number of other human rights issues of particular concern to our organisation which we call upon the UN Human Rights Council to explore when assessing the   About René Cassin  René Cassin is a human rights charitable organisation that uses historical Jewish experience and positive Jewish values to campaign and educate on universal human rights issues such as discrimination, slavery, detention and genocide.  The organisation is named in honour of René Cassin, a French Jew and Nobel Laureate who was one of the principal co-drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  René Cassin is a partner on a variety of UK and European coalitions and we are a joint signatory HR) Submission to the UPR.  It is intended that our submission build upon the points already highlighted in the BIHR Submission and emphasise concerns of specific importance to our organisation in light of our unique mission.  Section 1: the UK domestic human rights framework and the incorporation of international human rights standards into domestic law  UN Treaties  1. Although the UK has ratified most of the international human rights treaties, there are some notable omissions that we wish to highlight.  The UK has not ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, or the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.  We recommend that the UK signs up to these treaties, as an indication of the importance that the UK places on upholding universal human rights standards.  The UK should also ratify the optional protocols to the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.     3 2. In addition, some of the declarations and reservations which the UK has entered on various UN Treaties remain problematic and we recommend that they be reviewed with a view to being withdrawn.  For instance, tto the Convention in the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict is tantamount to a reservation.  We note that this declaration has not been reviewed or removed following the recommendation of the previous UPR1. UK domestic human rights framework 3. The Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) incorporated into UK law most of the rights set out in the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).  The rights contained in the Convention are to a large extent equivalent to most of the rights set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 4. There are efforts underway to undermine the HRA as evidenced by ongoing negative and misleading media coverage in the UK concerning the HRA; and the establishment of a Commission on a Bill of Rights Consultation, whose mandate makes no reference to the HRA.  We recommend that the UPR:  Makes reference to these developments;  Urges that any consultation as to whether or not a so-called Bill of Rights should be adopted in the UK acknowledge that the HRA is a bill of rights, although not referred to as such in public discourse;  Pronounces that to create a new UK Bill of Rights that is specific to the UK would be a regressive step if the rights in the HRA or the mechanisms for enforcing those rights were watered down; and  Calls upon the UK Government to guarantee that any attempt to introduce a Bill of Rights will maintain and build upon the existing HRA, rather than seeking its amendment or repeal. 5. The HRA provides that human rights are universal and apply to everyone equally.  The HRA has rightfully provided protections for minorities in circumstances where they had few other legal protections under UK law.  The evidence shows that the HRA has had a  improvements in the way                                                            1 See detailed submission from Child Soldiers International    4 individuals are treated throughout society.  These improvements range from changes in the way that public bodies make policy or deliver services through to opportunities for individuals to challenge poor treatment in domestic courts. 6. One particular concern is the failure to recognise the importance of the Section 6 Public Duty contained in the HRA.  The value of the Section 6 Public Duty was recognised by UK representatives in the previous universal periodic review. 2 7. I draw to the UPRattention the fact that the HRA brings to life provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ECHR, which originated in the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust, and which are  to a grave violation of human rights. 8. If a new UK Bill of rights is adopted, it should build on the HRA with respect to substantive protections and enforcement mechanisms and provide for additional rights as opposed to subtracting from those already instilled by the HRA.3  Professor Francesca Klug of the London School of Economics suggests certain indicators to test whether any new UK Bill of Rights builds on the HRA.  If these indicators are not incorporated into any new UK Bill of Rights, then the new Bill would constitute a regression as opposed to a progression towards the protection and enforcement of human rights within the UK. 9. We urge the Human Rights Council to strongly oppose any efforts by the UK to dilute the protections contained within the HRA or the enforcement mechanisms associated with them.  Protecting the HRA will help ensure that all individuals in the UK enjoy an equal level, quality, and accessibility of protection and enforcement of human rights.                                                            2 Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, A/HRC/8/25, Human Rights Council, Eighth session, Agenda item 6.    3 As Professor Francesca Klug of the London School of Economics (LSE) describes, there are certain indicators that test whether a new UK Bill of Rights supplements the existing HRA. These indicators include the following: (a)  supplement ECHR rights, not rephrase current rights in the HRA. They should demonstrably enhance rights protection. (b) There should be no additional qualifications or limitations attached to specific rights or a new  (c) There should be no new limitations on the scope of the rights in the HRA, which should continue to apply to everyone within the jurisdiction of the UK government.

The eviction may worsen already well-documented discrimination and hostility towards Travellers and Gypsies.5 ess to accept the offer by , to help broker a peaceful solution.6  We urge the Human Rights Council to recommend that:   Adequate provision of culturally appropriate sites is granted to Travellers and Gypsies;   The duty on local councils to provide sites for Travellers and Gypsies is reinserted; and  The UK complies with its international obligations including those with respect to housing and non-discrimination. 11.  Union (EU) Framework for National Roma Strategies up to 2020 recommended that the EU Member States, including the UK, develop national Roma Integration Strategies.  Although the UK Government and other EU Member States have instead agreed to a set of Conclusions on Roma Integration (Conclusions) in the areas of Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs, these Conclusions provide too wide a latitude to Member States and relegate the issue of Roma inclusion to merely part of broader social inclusion policies, when in fact the issue is of such urgency that it ought to be examined comprehensively in its own right.  Furthermore, the UK Government has stated that its establishment of a Ministerial Working Group, which has yet to publish a progress report or to consult stakeholders in a substantive way, amounts to sufficient discharge of its commitments                                                            4 Amnesty International, http://action.amnesty.org.uk/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1194&ea.campaign.id=11724&gclid=COH6mKr7rqwCFYEZ4QodrCB0GQ 5 http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/statements/DaleFarm_Statement.pdf 6 http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/19/dale-farm-evictions-un-negotiation    6 under the Conclusions.  We recommend that the UPR encourage the UK Government to address the issue of Roma integration and to develop detailed policies in this area. Asylum seekers and migrants Detention 12. The detention of asylum seekers remains a pressing concern, including the inappropriate detention of victims of torture and trafficking.  Over the last 3 months, the High Court has on two separate occasions found that the prolonged detention of mentally disordered people amounted to breaches of Article 3 of the ECHR. 13. The practice of long-term detention of migrants risks breaching Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR.  The UK is one of the few countries in Europe which uses immigration detention without time limit, having derogated from the EU Returns Directive that sets a maximum time limit of 18 months. 14. The use of detention for the purpose of administrative convenience - particularly by way of the Detained Fast Track (DFT) system - in processing asylum claims may breach Article 26 of the 1951 Refugee Convention and Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  We recommend that the DFT be abolished in order to ensure full compliance with the Refugee Convention and the ECHR.  We also urge that asylum seekers on the DFT be provided with a legal representative on their second day in detention at the latest, and that sufficient time be allocated to asylum seekers and their representatives. 15. Although migrants in detention may apply to the First Tier Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber for bail, the quality of scrutiny of bail has been criticised by several NGOs, including those that comprise part of the Detention Forum of which René Cassin is a member. 16. We urge that the UPR recommend that the UK protect migrants from arbitrary and indefinite detention by imposing a maximum time limit for detention in all cases.  We join our campaign coalition partners such as Detention Action in recommending that the UK follow best practice in the EU and implement a time limit of one month. 17. We also recommend that where deportation is imminent, this factor should have priority in decisions by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) and the First Tier Tribunal.  However, where deportation is not imminent, community-based alternatives to detention should always be adopted.    7 Abuses in paediatric medical care 18. The Yogyakarta Principles state the human right of all people irrespective of their age to genital autonomy.  Unnecessary genital surgeries based on social norms rather than medical needs are criminalised as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) when conducted on infants classified as female.  No such protections are granted to intersex infants in the UK.  We are concerned about the continued involvement of UK psychologists and medical professionals on interdisciplinary teams that conduct normalising surgeries on  These surgeries can cause permanent loss of sexual and bladder function, in addition to psychological trauma.  The recent IV World Congress on Hypospadias and Disorders of Sex Development (ISHID 2011), which was held at The Royal College of Surgeons and The UCH Education Centre in London and endorsed by professional societies in the field of paediatric endoan intersex infant and featured presenters who promoted the harmful drug Dexamethasone as a method of preventing intersex babies.  Dexamethasone has not been approved for this use by regulatory bodies and has been shown to cause cognitive impairment in pregnant mothers and foetuses7.  managed by health professionals that support intersex genital mutilation in the form of medically unnecessary normalising surgeries have also emerged in the UK. 19. Despite these irreversible surgeries to intersex infant genitals, transgender adolescents seeking access to gender-affirming hormones or reversible hormone blockers are routinely denied these options.  Many of these young people have been subjected to .  the basic human right of all young people to free expression and play. The World Standard genders is harmful and unethical8.  The Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) has been critiqued by transgender activists for allowing members to engage in these practices within the NHS.  A recent RCP conference featured speakers who advocate conversion therapy9.                                                            7 http://www.fetaldex.org/home.html 8 See http://www.wpath.org/documents/Standards%20of%20Care%20V7%20-%202011%20WPATH.pdf; and http://www.tsroadmap.com/notes/index.php/site/comments/wpath_reparative_therapy_on_transgender_youth_is_no_longer_considered_ethic/  9 https://transactivist.wordpress.com/tag/reparative-therapy/    8 Intersex legal discrimination 20. UK law does not currently allow intersex adults to change their sex designation, despite legal recognition of changes in designation for transgender adults.  Intersex NGOs and activists report not having been fully included by transgender NGOs and activists in consultation processes on the Gender Recognition Act (GRA).  Many intersex adults report having been denied a change of gender on government-issued identity documents under the GRA10.  Official policies and procedures should be investigated to ensure that they explicitly respect the legal right of intersex adults to obtain Gender Recognition Certificates (GRCs).  Officials who administer the GRCs need to be educated about human rights and their universal application, including to those people who are intersex; and to conduct proactive outreach to rectify the situations of intersex adults who have been unfairly denied GRCs. Proposals to further restrict Legal Aid 21. Government proposals to further restrict Legal Aid are currently being considered by the UK Parliament.  There is concern that these regressive proposals will make the provision of legal advice and representation inaccessible to many people in the UK, thereby placing their ability to enforce their rights at serious risk.  The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill sets out measures which would cut the legal aid system in England and Wales to save £350million from the £2.1billion legal aid budget.  This is part of a trend to roll back funding for legal aid.  The proposals seek to decrease funding for legal aid for housing, education, welfare, jobs, mental health and community care.  The proposals will see legal aid removed for partners of disabled people seeking welfare advice, families struggling with debt, and in family and immigration cases.  In these instances, the real impact of legal aid removal may be that people will be: prevented from being unified with their family; unable to obtain basic access to their children; or unable to seek remedies to protect themselves from domestic violence.                                                            10 http://www.susans.org/forums/index.php?topic=60042.0 ",english,"univers period

The Redress Trust (REDRESS) is an international human rights non-governmental organisation formed in 1992, based in London, with a mandate to assist torture survivors to seek justice and reparation. Its programmes include casework, law reform, research and advocacy. It has wide expertise and experience on the right to reparation for victims of torture under international law and takes cases on behalf of torture victims before national, regional and international human rights mechanisms, courts and tribunals.  period covered by the review, REseveral cases relating to torture issues, making written and oral submissions to parliamentary committees, making written submissions to the Baha Mousa Public Inquiry, advocating for the Torture (Damages) Bill, advocating for an effective public inquiry into allegations of complicity in torture, and advocating for the investigation and   COUNTER-TERRORISM AND TORTURE  A. Allegations of UK complicity in torture abroad  Detainee Inquiry  3. Consistent allegations of UK intelligence services having been complicit in torture abroad have been made in recent years, for example, by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights (JCHAllegations of UK Complicity in Torture1 on 4 August 2009 it  said that there was no other way to restore public confidence in the intelligence services than by setting up an independent inquiry into the numerous allegatiThe Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) released its report Human Rights Annual Report 20082 a week later, also expressing concern about the allegations of UK complicity in torture.  4. In July 2010 Prime Minister David Cameron announced that a judge-led inquiry (known as the Detainee Inquiry) would examine whether the UK was implicated in the improper treatment of detainees held by other countries that may have happened after 11 September 2001.3 The Terms of Reference4 and Protocol5 governing the Detainee Inquiry were published in August 2011. REDRESS and other NGOs,6 and the lawyers                                                  1 Available at http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200809/jtselect/jtrights/152/152.pdf. 2 Available at http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmfaff/557/557.pdf. 3 See the Detainee Inquiry website at http://www.detaineeinquiry.org.uk/. 4 Available at http://detaineeinquiry.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/20110706-The-Detainee-Inquiry-and-HM-Government-Terms-of-reference.pdf. 5 Available at http://detaineeinquiry.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/20110706-The-Detainee-Inquiry-and-HM-Government-Protocol.pdf. 6 REDRESS has been part of a group of ten human rights NGOs who have declined to give evidence to or attend further meetings with the Detainee Inquiry team: the other NGOs are Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Freedom from Torture, Reprieve, Justice, British Irish Rights Watch, Cage Prisoners, Liberty, and the Aire Centre. See the joint letter to the Detainee Inquiry dated 3 August 2011 available at http://www.redress.org/downloads/publications/Joint_NGO_letter_3-8-11.pdf.  3  representing detainees who have alleged ill-treatment, have declined to give evidence to, or have further meetings with, the Detainee Inquiry team due to concerns that the Detainee Inquiry would neither have, nor be seen to have, sufficient ability and  credibility to establish the truth about the allegations.  5failure of the Detainee Inquiry:   to explicitly address systemic problems (the allegations do not relate to isolated incidents) and achieve truth for victims;   to be sufficiently  independent,  open  and transparent  to  comply  with  human  rights  obligations and to be able to properly investigate  allegations  relating  to complicity in  torture;   to function within a realistic timeframe to achieve these objectives, bearing in -year target during which to investigate and report may not be sufficient;   to have adequate powers to compel the production of documents and the attendance of witnesses;   to hear all evidence in public unless there are legitimate national security reasons for doing otherwise;  to make use of tried and tested mechanisms (when legitimately necessary) such as shielded witnesses, so that junior security personal give evidence in open sessions, instead of all security service evidence being led in secret, apart from that by the heads of agencies, as set out in the Protocol;  to have an independent mechanism to  deal  with  challenges  by  interested  parties  for  disclosure of  documents, instead of the Protocol provision for the Government to have the final decision in such cases.  Safeguards  6. In July 2010 the Government published Consolidated Guidance to Intelligence Officers and Service Personnel on the Detention and Interviewing of Detainees Overseas, and on the Passing and Receipt of Intelligence Relating to Detainees.7 REDRESS submits that the requirement that UK security services must not proceed Guidance)  is  too  narrow, and  is  not consistent with its obligations under the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UNCAT). Specifically, article 2 of UNCAT prohibits torture absolutely and article 4 obliges state parties to criminalise torture and complicity in torture. The Guidance should explicitly prohibit an officer from proceeding where there is a serious or real risk of torture.   7. Where an officer knows or believes that torture will take place, he or she must report it, but  under the Guidance may,  with  authorisation,  continue  to  co-operate  with  the                                                   7 Available at https://update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/consolidated-guidance-iosp.pdf.  4  foreign  agencies responsible under the apparent discretionary power given to Ministers (paragraph 14 of the  Guidance). REDRESS is concerned that this could lead to complicity in torture contrary to article 4 of UNCAT. The guidance also allows officers to rely on assurance that detainees will not be tortured (paragraph  17  of  the  Guidance),  but  such  assurances  may  not  be reliable  and  cannot provide protection from regimes which are known to authorise torture.   Other concerns  8. Following a number of cases brought by former detainees suing the UK for the alleged involvement of its security services in their ill-treatment abroad, in October 2011 the Government published the Justice and Security Green Paper.8 This Green Paper contains proposals to improve our cou9 The Government is considering legislation to extend the use of Special Advocates to civil cases, involved. Special Advocates are already used in certain cases such as those concerning control orders and the deportation of terrorist suspects. They involve the use of security-cleared lawyers who in closed proceedings are engaged to represent the interests of persons but are not allowed to consult with them on the normal lawyer-client basis. This significantly increases the difficulties in challenging evidence led in these closed proceedings that may have been obtained by torture, for example, evidence obtained from agencies in third counties known to practice torture.  9these legislative changes are pursued, this  will  further  restrict  access  to  relevant  facts  and information in cases where torture is alleged, the disclosure of which could be crucial for survivors seeking to enforce their human rights in civil cases, that is, when seeking their right to a remedy and reparation based on allegations of UK involvement in torture.  B. Deportations with Assurances  10. , mainly in the context of counter-terrorism when for evidential reasons it has been decided that terrorist suspects present or resident in the UK cannot be prosecuted. To deport terrorist suspects to states where -refoulement obligations.10 In March 2011 the UK stated it had DWA arrangements with five countries - Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya and Ethiopia.11  The UK was committed to concluding                                                  8 Available at http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm81/8194/8194.pdf. 9 Ibid, Forward, page vii. 10 The absolute principle of non-refoulement is set out in Article 3(1) of the UNCAT. 11 Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Human Rights and Democracy: The 2010 Foreign and Commonwealth Office Report, March 2011, page 49, available at http://centralcontent.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/human-rights-reports/accessible-hrd-report-2010.  5  such arrangements with more countries in 2011.12 The arrangement with Libya was subsequently abandoned at some point during the UN-sanctioned intervention, as st, but for obvious 13  11Assurances demonstrates a strong commitment to dealing with a vital security issue in a way that complies with our domestic an14 REDRESS believes that there remain fundamental problems with deporting persons on the basis of assurances, that post-deportation monitoring is not an adequate safeguard in states where torture is known to be authorised, and that the real question remains as to whether detainees should be returned to such states at all. Instead, the UK should consider alternatives, such as enhancing  the  collection  of admissible  evidence  for  prosecutions  in  terrorist-suspect  cases, for example through legislative changes  relating  to  the  use  of  intercept evidence  and/or  post-charge questioning, which  could  be viable alternatives to DWAs.  CONFLICT AND TORTURE  A. Extra-territorial reach   12.  Numerous allegations have arisen of serious human rights violations including torture by UK armed forces abroad. Some of these incidents have been verified, for example, in the report of the Baha Mousa Public Inquiry,15 while others are still the subject of other inquiries and litigation.  13. The UK does not consider that UNCAT applies extra-territorially, for example, in Iraq and/or Afghanistan, to UK armed force who were or are in those states. However, this is contrary to the jurisprudence of the  in Al Skeini16 that Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) does have extra-territorial application to detainees held in custody by UK personnel anywhere abroad. Furthermore, two 2011 decisions of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), in Al-Skeini v United Kingdom17 and Al-Jedda v United Kingdom18 confirm human rights obligations are not limited to UK territory but can exceptionally extend overseas when its  over foreign nationals.                                                   12 Ibid. 13 Mr Jeremy Browne, Minister of State (with responsibility for human rights in the Foreign Office) giving evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee on 23 May 2011: see House of Commons  Foreign Affairs Committee, Rights Work 201011, Eighth Report of Session 201012, Volume 1, published 20 July 2011,  Evidence page 20,  Q69, available at http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmfaff/964/964.pdf. 14 Foreign and Commonwealth Office, FCO Strategy for the Prevention of Torture, 2011-2015, October 2011, page 10, available at http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/fcostrategy-tortureprevention. 15 See the report published on 8 September 2011 available at http://www.bahamousainquiry.org/report/index.htm. 16 Al Skeini and Others v Secretary of State and Another, [2007] UKHL 26. 17 Application No. 55721/07. 18 Application No. 27021/08.  6  14. On the same basis, REDRESS believes that the UK should accept the extra-territorial application of UNCAT and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to the actions of its officials abroad.  B. Inquiries  15. As mentioned above there are other inquiries relating to allegations of abuses committed abroad, such as the Al-Sweady Public Inquiry,19 as well as cases pending before UK courts such as in Ali Zaki Mousa.20 REDRESS is concerned that there is an underlying inability on the part of the UK to deal with the absolute prohibition of torture when its armed forces are allegedly involved, reflected in the continued need for inquiries to be set up and litigation to be launched to establish the truth of allegations.   INVESTIGATION/PROSECUTION OF SUSPECTS WITHIN UK JURISDICTION  16. The UK is obliged to investigate and then either prosecute or extradite torture the Criminal Justice Act 1988 which criminalises torture no matter where it was committed, as set out under UNCAT.  17.  The UK should not be a safe haven, nor simply allow suspects to enter and then leave for other safe havens, such as tMusa Kusa, who defected to the UK in March 2011 but was then allowed to leave, apparently for Doha, where he remains. Tobligations as set out above. In 2011, Parliament was told21 that the UK Border Agency War Crimes Team recommended that immigration action should be taken against 495 war crimes suspects; it is important to know how these suspected criminals have been identified and what is being done to hold them accountable.   18. Legislative changes made in 2011 make it more difficult to obtain what are termed private arrest warrants when victims seek to have arrested suspects of international crimes coming to the UK. The result of the changes require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions before such a warrant can be issued. The changes have not been conducive to strengthening the prospect for prosecutions. Instead of making such                                                  19 See http://www.alsweadyinquiry.org/index.htm.  20 Ali Zaki Mousa and Others v Secretary of State for Defence, Court of Appeal, Case no. C1/2011/0524 B; for details of the case and REDRESs intervention see http://www.redress.org/downloads/_website_.pdf. 21 See Hansard, Home Department Written Answers, 15 February 2011, 40826, available at http://services.parliament.uk/hansard/Commons/ByDate/20110215/writtenanswers/part006.htm.l  7  prosecutions more difficult, a concerted approach aimed at effectively ending impunity for suspects of international crimes who enter the UK is needed.22  19. that repeated extradition requests could be appropriate in genocide cases and for other international crimes over which the UK has universal jurisdiction. Such a practice undermines efforts to combat impunity. It means known suspects can live freely in the UK for years at a time without being brought to trial. This is illustrated by the case of four Rwandan genocide suspects resident in the UK who have remained un-investigated, despite a court ruling in April 2009 refusing to allow their extradition to Rwanda for trial on fair trial grounds. Instead of subsequently investigating them with a view to prosecuting them in the UK, which has jurisdiction, the UK has waited for Rwanda to make a second extradition request.  REDRESS is concerned about the resultant delays in the delivery of justice,23 as well as the general failure of the UK to implement its prosecute or extradite obligations.   ARTICLE 22 OF UNCAT AND THE SECOND OPTIONAL PROTOCOL OF THE ICCPR  20. The UK has not made a declaration under article 22 of UNCAT accepting the right of individual petition, nor has it ratified the Second Optional Protocol of the ICCPR. The procedures provides victims with an opportunity to raise allegations of specific or systemic violations under UNCAT with the Committee Against Torture and under the ICCPR with the Human Rights Committee, respectively. Individual petitions would constitute an important additional avenue that would give individuals a direct role in proceedings and would enable the committees UNCAT and ICCPR obligations beyond periodic reporting.  21. Tmessage in the international campaign against torture, a campaign in which the UK has played a positive role. By making a declaration under article 22 and by ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR the UK would be an example to other states, and would help to strengthen the respective committees, which are recognised as the bodies specifically created to develop international standards, whose decisions in turn can positively impact on domestic jurisprudence and provide acknowledgment of the harm suffered by individual complainants.                                                   22 See Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill: Joint briefing for House of Lords Committee stage: 14 June 2011: Clause 154  Changes to arrest procedure for international crimes, available at http://www.redress.org/downloads/publications/Joint_briefing_HLCS.pdf. 23 See REDRESS, UK Extradition Policy: Submission to the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) 27 January 2011, available at http://www.redress.org/downloads/publications/JCHR%20Submission%2027%20January%202011.pdf.  8  RECOMMENDATIONS  REDRESS makes the following recommendations to the UK:   human rights obligations  To ensure that guidelines and legislation relating to the actions of officials abroad are always fully compliant with the absolute prohibition against torture  To abandon proposals to extend closed material procedures to civil cases and thereby curtail the rights of civil litigants in cases where national security issues are involved  To acknowledge that its obligations under UNCAT and by extension the ICCPR apply extra-territorially to all activities of its officials   To cease making use of deportations with assurances for terrorist suspects  To eas to stop the UK being a safe haven for serious human rights violators  To make a declaration under article 22 of UNCAT accepting the right of individual petition and to ratify the Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR   21 November 2011  Kevin Laue, REDRESS UK Legal Advisor.

58,SAMH - The Scottish Association for Mental Health," SAMH, Brunswick House, 51 Wilson Street, Glasgow, G1 1UZ  1                                             The Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH)   UPR Submission  UK  Session:  2012                     SAMH, Brunswick House, 51 Wilson Street, Glasgow, G1 1UZ  2 1.  SAMH   1.1 SAMH is a mental health charity which provides an independent voice on all matters of relevance to people with mental health and related problems and delivers direct support to 3000 people through 84 services across Scotland. SAMH provides direct line-management to respectme --stigma campaign).   1.2 rights underpin our society and our lives.  The campaign seeks to improve recognition of the links between mental health and human rights, publicise the human rights of people with mental health problems, and secure human rights protection for individuals and their families. 2.  NATIONAL FRAMEWORK 2.1 The Scottish Government is the devolved government for Scotland. It develops and implements policy, and is accountable to the Scottish Parliament.  It is responsible for many issues, including health, education, and justice.  Local authorities and the wider public sector in Scotland are expected to work towards achieving national outcomes set by the Scottish Government. The central UK Government remains responsible for national policy on all matters that have not been devolved to Scotland, including foreign affairs, defence, social security, and trade.     3.  SUMMARY   3.1 Since the Scottish Parliament was established, there has been good progress on mental health.  Suicide rates have fallen, as have re-admission rates to psychiatric hospitals, and there is less stigma about mental health problems.  New targets have been developed to improve access to psychological tmental health services.  The Scottish Government has also announced that it is to develop a new Mental Health Strategy for Scotland, which, for the next four years, will help shape the way Scotland approaches mental health.     3.2 However, mental health is still largely seen as an issue solely for the National Health Service (NHS).  Outside the health care context, the stigma and misconceptions associated with mental health problems mean that many people experiencing them are marginalised and ostracised from society.  They can be excluded from community life and discriminated against in the fields of employment, education, welfare and justice. As a consequence, many people with mental health problems are living in poverty1 which in turn, affects their ability to gain access to appropriate care, integrate into society and recover.  3.3 We have structured our response to focus on those areas where we believe more could be done to realise the rights of people who experience mental health problems, and to ensure that everyone can enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.  Many of the issues we raise are relevant to a broad cross-section of human rights obligations and commitments, including those set out in the United Nations                                             1 Office for National Statistics, The Social and Economic Circumstances of Adults with Mental Disorders 2002    SAMH, Brunswick House, 51 Wilson Street, Glasgow, G1 1UZ  3 Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the range of Human Rights Conventions to which the UK is a party.     4. SPECIFIC COMMENTS    Implementation of ICESCR: Article 12 - The right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health  4.1 In 2009, SAMH assisted the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to monitor implementation of the ICESCR in the UK.  The Concluding Observations2 recommended action in a number of areas, including: address, as a matter of priority, the poor health conditions for persons with mental   4.2 SAMH has seen no formal response by the Scottish Government to implement this recommendation.  Publicly funded services for people who have a mental health problem remain extremely vulnerable in the current economic climate; with many experiencing both cost cutting and closure as local authorities attempt to balance priorities in financially challenging times.  Furthermore, SAMH does not believe that the human rights of the people who use these services are always the paramount consideration of local authorities.   4.3 All public authorities in Scotland must be reminded of their ICESCR obligations to invest the maximum amount of their available resources to enable individuals to progressively realise the highest attainable standard of mental health, as well as their obligation to fulfil3 when making regressive decisions such as cutting funding for mental health services despite the evidenced need.   4.4 The Scottish Government, local authorities and the public sector all need to adopt a human rights framework for mental health policies and services to ensure that effective treatment, prevention and promotion programmes are available to people when and where they need them. However, research commissioned by SAMH has identified an absence of evidence that human rights have been used as an ethos and as a way of working to improve the delivery of public services in Scotland. 4     ICESCR: The Right to Work   4.5 People with mental health problems want to work, but 79% of people with long-lasting mental health problems are currently unemployed5.  The low rates of employment for people with mental health problems could be the result of a number of factors, including a combination of stigma and discrimination, low expectations, and a lack of appropriate supports.                                                  2  Concluding Observations of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,  Forty-second session 4 - 22 May 2009 3 The obligation to fulfil means that States must take positive action to facilitate the enjoyment of basic human rights 4 Delivering Human Rights in Scotland, SAMH, SWA, SRC and AI, February 2011 &  Public Authorities and the Human Rights Act, Scottish Executive Central Research Unit, 2001.  5 Scottish Government, Disability and Employment in Scotland: review of evidence base, 2005   SAMH, Brunswick House, 51 Wilson Street, Glasgow, G1 1UZ  4 4.6 The Scottish Government must encourage employers to recognise and fulfill their responsibilities.  Fewer than four in ten employers would consider employing someone with a history of mental health problems, compared to more than six in ten for candidates with physical disability6.  Initiatives to address misunderstandings about mental health among employers and employees should be supported.  This could include improving the range of support and advice available to employers, and encouraging awareness training for staff to increase knowledge and understanding of mental health.     Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities                              Article 28 - Adequate standard of living and social protection  4.7 At the root of many mental health problems lies poverty and deprivation, and people from the most deprived areas have the highest proportion of mental health problems7. The UK Government has announced a radical welfare reform programme intended to target support for disabled people at those with the greatest need.   The UK Government has also announced a concurrent objective to achieve an overall reduction in the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) budget of 20%, which has formed the basis of DLA reform.   4.8 SAMH believes that this reform should be based on supporting disabled people to lead fulfilling lives and not primarily concerned with reducing costs.  Furthermore, as DLA people, who still need support, will receive reduced support.  People with mental health problems, particularly those with long-term problems, are among the most socially excluded groups of people.  The UK Government must reconsider its welfare reform programme to ensure that disabled people are not further disadvantaged and pushed into poverty by the effects of welfare reform.     Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities                                   Article 6: Women with disabilities  4.9 Scotland has one of the fastest-growing female prisoner populations in Europe and in the past decade, it has more than doubled.8 woman only prison) concluded that 98% of the inmates had drug addiction problems and 80% had mental health problems.9 The same report also highlighted that the conditions remand prisoners face could be very threatening for women who may have addiction or mental health problems.    4.10 SAMH is particularly concerned that women with mental health problems are disproportionately found within the criminal justice system as community services are failing to address their needs.  One study has found that some Scottish women face such huge problems that they regard a jail term as ""a refuge""; some choosing jail to escape abusive partners, others using a prison term to try to stabilise debt problems or drug                                             6 C Manning and PD White, Psychiatric Bulletin, 19 (1995). 7 Taulbut, M., Parkinson, J., Catto, S. and Gordon, D.

Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities    Article 7: Children with disabilities   4.11 SAMH does not believe that children accessing mental health services always get services that are appropriate to their needs.  Legally, NHS boards are obliged to provide appropriate accommodation and care for those under 18, but the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland (MWC) has raised concerns that this is still not happening in some areas.11 The MWC has also recently reported that the likelihood of a young person being treated in a specialist unit varand where they live.12 The Scottish Government should ensure appropriate mental health services are available to children and young people across Scotland.    The Right to life  4.12 In Scotland, suicide is one of the leading causes of death among young people, 13 and research shows that the suicide risk is raised for people experiencing virtually all mental health problems.14 Encouragingly, the suicide rate in Scotland has reduced by 14% between 2000-02 and 2009-10. 15  However, there were 781 suicides in Scotland in 2010, which is an increase on the 2009 figure; equating to an age-sex-standardised rate of 14.7 per 100,000 population. 16  There is still much more to do to reduce suicide, to prevent both the loss of life and the devastation it causes to families and friends.     4.13 Local Authorities in Scotland have committed to reducing suicide rates in Scotland by 20% by 2013, in line with the targets laid out in National Outcomes. This work is primarily carried out using funding from the Choose Life programme, to provide suicide prevention training and awareness raising.  This funding and these targets should be maintained but there is currently no requirement on Local Authorities to spend Choose Life funding on suicide prevention activities. SAMH is concerned that, particularly in the context of widespread cuts to public spending, Local Authorities may be under pressure to divert these funds to other areas.   Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Article 16: Freedom from exploitation, violence and abuse  4.14 SAMH greatly welcomed a recent strengthening of Scottish law to help protect disabled people from hate crime.  People with mental health problems are 11 times more                                             10 Female drug users in prison and after release: A five-country follow-up study in Europe on relapse prevention, EU Report, 2007   11 Our Annual Report, The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, 2007-2008 12 Our Annual Report, The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, 2009-2010  13 Information Services Division, Suicide Statistics 2010, 05/08/2011 14  Psychiatry, 170, 205-28 15 Information Services Division, Suicide Statistics 2010, 05/08/2011 16 Information Services Division, Suicide Statistics 2010, 05/08/2011   SAMH, Brunswick House, 51 Wilson Street, Glasgow, G1 1UZ  6 likely to be victimised than society as a whole17.  Recent survey research18 uncovered that 71 per cent of respondents with mental health problems had been the victim of a crime in the last two years and felt this to be related to their mental health history.     4.15 Although disability related hate crime is now recognised in legislation, there remains a deep lack of awareness about hate crime committed against people with mental health problems.  More needs to be done by the Scottish Government to prevent hate crime occurring and to ensure that people are able to access support and justice when it does.  SAMH would also like to see guidance issued to sentencers about the new hate crime legislation, as well as regular reviews to monitor the implementation and impact of the Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Act 2009.     4.16 Time and again, people with mental health problems tell us that stigma and ignorance about mental health problems is rife.  Stigma can range from being ignored and excluded to verbal and physical harassment and abuse.  Whilst stigma is reducing in Scotland, there is still not enough public understanding about the difficulties facing people with mental health problems.  The Scottish Government must continue to fund anti-stigma work if it is to achieve real and lasting progress in this regard.    5 Conclusion   5.1 There is an absence of action plans to implement human rights in Scotland which makes the process of monitoring, evaluation and accountability very difficult.  However, SAMH believes that much more remains to be done to ensure that people who experience mental ill-health are fully able to access their human rights.  This includes taking action to ensure that people with mental problems have equal opportunities to work, access safe and effective health services, move out of poverty, and live their lives free from violence and abuse.   5.2 In this submission, we have highlighted the areas and actions which we believe should be a priority for the Scottish and UK Governments.  SAMH would urge the Human Rights Council to make these recommendations to the relevant governments in order to progress human rights and mental health and wellbeing for all.                                               17  People with mental illness more often crime victims.

59,SC - Save the Children UK," 1          Submission by Save the Children1 related to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Universal Periodic Review (UPR)  13th session  21 May to 1 June 2012  ights in the UK: Key issues of concern for Save the Children    For more information contact:  Save the Children   London EC1M 4AR  www.savethechildren.org.uk   Louise King,  UK Child Rights Policy Advisor:  l.king@savethechildren.org.uk  +44 (0) 20 7012 6762   Chris Wellings,  Head of UK Policy:  c.wellings@savethechildren.org.uk  +44 (0) 20 7012 676                                                        1 Save the Children has ECOSOC status with the UN   2 1) INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF IN THE UK  General measures of implementation (GMI) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)   Introduction  1.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (the UN Committee) has made it clear that if a State party is to fully implement the CRC then it must take serious steps to realise the GMI. 1    2.  In its 2008 Concluding Observations, the UN Committee issued 20 recommendations in relation to the GMI2, many of which still need to be addressed.  In 2011, Save the Children launched a report, which assessed how far the UK Government and the devolved administrations of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are realising the GMI.3 It found that whilst there had been some progress there was an urgent need to do much better, particularly in the following areas:   Declaration to the Optional Protocol to the CRC on the involvement of children in armed conflicts (OPAC)  3.  When the UK Government ratified OPAC it put in place a declaration which set out a number of circumstances when it might not be possible to prevent the deployment of under-18s in hostilities. Recommendations were to:   4.  the Child and the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflictconcerning the provision that detained children be separated from adults while in detention, as well as the withdrawal of their reservation concerning refugee and   5.  Commendably, the UK Government has removed its remaining reservations to the CRC but has not withdrawn its declaration to OPAC.    6.  The UK Government should:  Remove its declaration to OPAC to ensure that children are never deployed in hostilities   Incorporation of the CRC into UK domestic law  7. In its General Comment No 5, the UN Committee makes it clear that it expects States to make the CRC fully judiciable.4 In 2008 it recommended that the UK take the opportunity given in this regard by the development of a Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland and a British Bill of Rights, and incorporate into them the principles of the UNCRC.   8.  Following an i, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights with those witnesses who emphasised the benefits of incorporation, accompanied by directly enforceable rights.5The Rights of the Child UK Coalition6 and  also calling for progress.7  9.  With the exception of positive developments in Wales and Scotland (see below), little progress has been made on incorporating the CRC into UK domestic law. The UK ratified the CRC nearly 20 years ago yet a wealth of evidence demonstrates that children across the UK do not have adequate realisation of their rights.8 Incorporation is needed so the CRC is the standard against which all law, policy and practice affecting children is judged.    3  Wales  10. The Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011 creates a legal requirement for international child rights standards to be taken into account as part of Ministerial decision-making and policy development in Wales and places a legal duty on Welsh Ministers to promote CRC knowledge and understanding. If implemented effectively, this will help ensure the Welsh Government is held accountable in the realisation of rights.    11. It is now critical that the Welsh Government takes forward the opportunity offered by this legislation to realise the rights of children across Wales and allocates sufficient financial and human resources to effectively implement it.   Scotland  13. In September 2011, the Scottish Government issued a consultation on a proposed Rights of Children and Young People Bill, which will place a Ministerial duty on Scottish Ministers to have due regard to the CRC in the exercise of any of their functions.9 Whilst this is welcome, we urge the Scottish Government to go further and fully incorporate the CRC into Scottish Law (within the boundaries of devolution) and ensure that the legislation requires Ministers to set out and consult on the implementation plans of such a duty and raise awareness of the CRC.   Northern Ireland 14. The 1998 Belfast Agreement includes a commitment to develop a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. In 2006, a Bill of Rights Forum, made up of representatives from across civil society was established to advise the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC).  15. The Forum submitted its final report to the NIHRC in March 2008 and in December 2008 the Commission issued its advice to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on what the content of such a Bill should contain, this included seven specific 10  16. Since the publication of a disappointing consultation on the next steps of this process by the previous Administration in 2009, there have been no further developments. The Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People has argued that the Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland is a clear opportunity to incorporate the CRC.11 We agree.   17. The UK Government should:   Seek to incorporate the CRC into UK law at the earliest opportunity  Take forward the opportunity afforded by the Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland to incorporate the CRC taking into account the recommendations of the NIHRC    The devolved governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland should also take forward effective CRC incorporation within the devolved legislative framework. In particular: o The Welsh Government should ensure that it puts in place the necessary resources and mechanisms to ensure that the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure is fully implemented    o The Scottish Government should ensure the Rights of Children and Young People Bill fully incorporate the CRC into Scottish Law (within the boundaries of devolution) and ensure that the legislation requires Ministers to set out and consult on the implementation plans of such a duty and raise awareness of the CRC     4 UK Bill of Rights and the Human Rights Act  18. In 2011 the UK Government announced the establishment of a Commission on a Bill of Rights (the Commission) - due to report at the end of 2012. Save the Children believes that the UK should have a UK Bill of Rights that affords greater protection for the rights of all (including under 18s) as well as particular rights for children  thus taking forward CRC incorporation.  We would like to stress that it is imperative that any proposals for a UK Bill of Rights builds on the strong provisions afforded by the Human Rights Act (HRA) and does not undermine or dilute this protection in any way.   19. We share the concerns of many across the NGO sector and beyond that the process of the Commission could lead to the current legal protection of human rights in the UK being undermined. We would be extremely concerned if this was the outcome of the Commission. Since its enactment, Save the Children has recognised and promoted the crucial role that the HRA plays in the protection of the rights of children.12   20. We share the alarm of many that the Coalition Agreement13 and the Terms of Reference of the Commission do not refer specifically to the HRA but only to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Whilst this is welcome, it does not equal commitment to the HRA and as such is a cause for concern. The HRA itself is fundamental because it protects the rights of everyone, including all children in the UK, by providing a means of legal redress through the UK courts where these rights have been breached and places a duty on government to ensure that new laws are compatible with the HRA and ensures that all public authorities uphold these rights in all their activities.14   21. It is imperative that any proposals for a UK Bill of Rights build upon on this important legal instrument.   22. The Commission on a Bill of Rights should:  Recommend that any proposals for a UK Bill of Rights builds upon the provisions of the Human Rights Act and incorporates the CRC into UK domestic law   The UK Government should:   Ensure that any proposals for a UK Bill of Rights build upon the provisions of the Human Rights Act and incorporates the CRC into UK domestic law and do not undermine the process for a Northern Ireland Bill of Rights    ommissioners  23. s Commissioners have been established across the UK but steps still need to be taken to ensure that they all meet the requirements for independent human rights institutions for children set out by the Paris Principles15 and the UN Committee.16   24. Currently, tis inadequately linked to the CRC. Commendably, the UK Government recently published proposals to change the statutory remit of the English Commissioner so it is rights based. These proposals should be taken forward as soon as possible, taking into account the responses it received from stakeholders during the consultation process. 17  25. The UK Government and the devolved administrations should:  Amend legislation comply with international standards  Making children visible in budgets     5 26. Commendably, the Welsh Government has made good progress in relation to s budgets, but progress is lacking in the rest of the UK, despite a recommendation by the UN Committee in 2008.18  The fCommissioners have concluded that location of resources [for children] is not dependent on assessed need, is not transparent, is often of short-term nature and its impact in outcomes for children are 19  27. With deep spending cuts being implemented across the UK, many of which will impact on the most vulnerable,   28. The UK Government, the Scottish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive should:   Use the experience of the Welsh Government to set out spend on children at both national and local levels with a view to ascertaining how effectively their rights are being realised  The Welsh Government should:  Maintain and build on its progress to improve the visibility of children in its budgets  IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS IN RELATION TO CHILDREN    29. Analysis of action on the UN Committee2008 Concluding Observations shows there has been little progress in taking forward many of the recommendations. Below we highlight a key issue for Save the Children, which requires urgent attention.    Child poverty  Meeting child poverty targets  30. , it received recommendations to: programmes aimed at addressing socio-economic inequalities, from a human rights perspective in fulfilment of its obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and    31. Article 27 gives children the right to an adequate standard of living. In 2008 the UN Committee welcomed the commitment to end child poverty by 2020 but noted that 20  It recommended that the State party Adopt and adequately implement the legislation aimed at achieving the target of ending child poverty by 2020, including by establishing measurable indicators for their achievement; Give priority in this legislation and in the follow-up actions to those children and their families in most need of support; and w intensify its efforts to provide material assistance and support progr 21  32. Similarly, in 2009 the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights raised concern that poverty and fuel poverty, especially among children, remain wide-spread. 22   33. Despite these strong recommendations, levels of child poverty remain unacceptably high throughout the UK: 3.5 million children live in poverty in the UK (after housing costs)23, with 1.6 million children living in severe poverty (13% of all children). In some local areas (including Manchester and a number of London Boroughs) around one in four children are living in severe poverty.24 The UK Government has acknowledged severe child poverty as a major issue and included a focus on severe poverty in its first Child Poverty Strategy (see below), but it has not set out a clear plan or target to eradicate or reduce severe poverty.      6 34. 900,000 children were lifted out of poverty between 1999 and 2010 but this fell short of the target to halve child poverty by around 800,000 during that same period.25 The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) have projected that child poverty will begin to rise again after 201326 and will reach 3.3million (before housing costs) and 4.2million (after housing costs) by 2020. In effect, the progress made in reducing child poverty between 1999 and 2010 will have been reversed.   35. , published in April 2011,27 failed to set out a clear pathway towards reaching the 2020 target. Whilst we welcome the focus on early years in the Strategy, there needs to be a much clearer recognition of the financial pressures currently facing families and the impact this is having on the health, education and well-being of children.  36. Reaching the 2020 target requires significant political will and investment: Meeting the 2010 target required an extra annual investment of 4.2billion28 in tax credits. It is likely that a similar level of investment will be required to meet the 2020 target. This investment would help low income families at a time of welfare retrenchment, wage stagnations, public service cuts and increasing levels of unemployment.  37. The IFS child poverty projections cited the change in the way benefits are uprated - moving from the Retail Price Index (includes housing costs) to the Consumer Price Index (excludes housing costs) - as the main reason behind the expected large increase in child poverty between now and 2020. This move is seen as a cost saving measure by the UK Government but it will have a detrimental impact on the finances of the poorest families.    38. The UK Government should:   Invest in Child Tax Credits and benefits so that levels of child poverty do not increase  Set out a clear pathway towards meeting the 2020 target   Set a target to eradicate severe child poverty by the end of the Parliament  Reduce in-work poverty and ensure employment is an effective route out of poverty by allocating the resources needed to create clear work incentives for parents so that they keep more of earnings  The Education achievement gap  39. The evidence on how socio-economic background affects early learning and development is stark. Using data from the 1970 British Cohort Study research has background can be seen as early as 22 months29 A study, which tracks children born in 2000/01, shows those who experienced persistent poverty or episodes of poverty scored markedly less well at age five in English schools than those who grew up free from poverty.30   40. Statistics for England from the Department for Education show that at every stage of schooling the poorest children do worse and make less progress than their better-off peers. At the Early Years Foundation Stage 39% of children eligible for free school meals showed a good level of development compared to 59% of their peers. At age 11, 62% of FSM pupils scored expected levels in English compared to 83% of their classmates. Children from poorer homes are around half as likely to get five good GCSEs as their classmates.31   41. In 2008, the UN Committee significant inequalities persist with regard to school achievement of children living with their parents in economic 32 and recommended that the State party: Continue and strengthen its efforts to reduce the effects of the social background of children on their achievement in school.33    7 42. The UK Government and devolved administrations should:   Ensure that resources (school funding and the best teachers) are targeted on the poorest pupils;  accountability systems prioritise closing the attainment gap; and admissions rules promote equity   Make certain that family support programmes that help parents to engage with are widely available in every community and are a universal entitlement in deprived neighbourhoods  Give support to schools so they can effectively allocate the Pupil Premium (extra school funding attached to each child from a poor home) and provide them with evidence on what works in terms of closing the achievement gap  Provide children living in deprived communities with opportunities to realise their potential by offering them a range of support that goes beyond education London, 21 November 2011                                               1 Articles 4, 42 and 44.6 of the CRC and UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (2003) General Comment no.5 (2003) General Measures of Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (arts. 4, 42 and 44.6)  2 UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (2008) Concluding Observations on the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 3 Save the Children (2011) Governance fit for Children: To what extent have the general measures of implementation of the CRC been realised in the UK  4 General Comment no.5 (2003) General Measures of Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (arts. 4, 42 and 44.6)  5 -fifth Report of Session 2008-09 Paragraph 28 6 Made up of 24 organisations from across the UK, the ROCK coalition members are: Article 12 in Scotland, the British Humanist Association, the Centre for Studies on Inclusive Education, the Child Rights Information  The Children's Society, the Fatherhood Institute, the Howard League for Penal Reform, the National Youth Advocacy Service, the National Youth Agency, NCB, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Save the Children, Scope, the Scottish Alliance for Children's Rights, Sefton Voices, Shelter, Children's Legal Service, Unicef UK, Voice, Who cares?

60,SCFS - The Scottish Campaign for a Fair Society," SCOTTISH CAMPAIGN FOR A FAIR SOCIETY  COALITION STAKEHOLDER SUBMISSION UN UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW 2012 The Scottish Campaign for a Fair Society is supported by a range of organisations, including ALTRUM, Alzheimer Scotland, Coalition of Care and Support Providers in Scotland (CCPS), Down's Syndrome Scotland, ENABLE Scotland, Inclusion Scotland, In Control Scotland, Independent Living in Scotland, Learning Disability Alliance Scotland, Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland (LTCAS), People First (Scotland), Sense Scotland, Values Into Action Scotland (VIAS).i  1. THE SCOTTISH CAMPAIGN FOR A FAIR SOCIETY 1.1 The Campaign for a Fair Society is a UK wide popular movement to challenge the unfair cuts that target the most vulnerable and to propose positive principles for a better system. Established in February 2011, the Scottish Campaign for a Fair Society believes everyone is equal, no matter their differences or disabilities. A fair society sees each of its members as a full citizen - a unique person with a life of their own.  1.2 We want to see the Governments of Westminster and Holyrood reverse, as a matter of urgency, the unfair cuts that target disabled people: more than 25% of the cuts fall on the most vulnerable 3% of the population. The Campaign has developed a seven point manifesto proposing radical welfare reform that includes promotion of independent living for older and disabled people, and full commitment to international human rights instruments (including the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Disabled People). In preparing this submission, we have used consultation materials drawn from individual consultations conducted by member organisations, and we also refer to secondary evidence.    2  2. NATIONAL FRAMEWORK 2.1 The Scottish Government is the devolved government for Scotland. It develops and implements policy, and is accountable to the Scottish Parliament. It is responsible for many issues related to welfare reform, although the governance on this is reserved to Westminster, including health, many aspects of social care, education and justice. The central UK government remains responsible for national policy on all matters that have not been devolved to Scotland, including foreign affairs, defence, trade and social security.  2.2 In this submission, we focus on the actions of both the UK and the Scottish governments and highlight where they each have a responsibility or impact on the realisation of human rights for disabled and older people in Scotland.  3  3. SUMMARY  3.1 Since the Scottish Parliament was established, there has been some good progress on establishing the principles of independent living in Scotland. For example, in 2009, the Scottish Government, along with COSLA and the newly established Independent Living in Scotland Project (funded by the Scottish Government) signed a joint statement committing to working together to realise the agreed vision therein. This vision was based on the core principles of choice, control, freedom and dignity; that disabled people across Scotland would have equality of opportunity at home and work, in education and in the social and civic life of the community. The joint statement established a steering group for the project made up of disabled people and disability organisations.  3.2 In a recent spending review, the Scottish Government committed to a programme of preventative spending, which we endorse as a way of ensuring people get the support and care they need at the point that it ensures independent living, rather than at a later point of emergency. For example, the Scottish government has recently proposed new mental health strategy which, over the next four years, will help shape the way that Scotland approaches mental health. However, there remain areas in which the Scottish Government can improve on its delivery of human rights, and potentially mitigate against some the worst effects of the cuts through the preventative spend approach to services it has committed to take. 3.3 In spite of some of the achievements made by the Scottish Government, we remain concerned that many rights that disabled people have fought hard for over the past 20-welfare reform programme which is motivated by budget cuts. Disabled people are terms of their income and the services they receive.  3.5 Due to our focus on the rights of disabled people, the main focus for specific comments within this submission is on those rights contained in the UN Convention on the Rights of Disabled People (UN CRPD)1; where other instruments apply, these will also be highlighted.                                                             1 Ratified by the UK on 8 June 2009.    4  4. SPECIFIC COMMENTS Progress of Implementation of the UN CRDP  4.1 Article 10 The right to life 4.1.1 We are very concerned about the numbers of disabled people taking their own lives and the connection that these deaths have with the budget cuts. There have been several recent suicides among disabled people across the UK that appear to have been as a direct consequence of people losing or not qualifying for disability and housing benefits. We are concerned that the suicide rate connected to cuts to these benefits will rise as the effects of the proposed Welfare Reform Bill, once implemented, are felt.  4.1.2 Women who receive a pre-natal diagnosis of disability for their child are being allowed to abort the baby up to 24 weeks into pregnancy, when many babies are born safely if prematurely at this time. Additionally, under the 1967 Abortion Act, , yet there is no definition therein being advised to abort their child upon diagnosis of disability where there is a good chance that the child could have a good quality of life with the right interventions and support available for the family.    4.2 Article 12 Access to equitable Justice and Article 13 Equal recognition before the law 4.2.1 The Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act and its guidelines have the potential to violate a number of rights in the Convention. The rights within articles 12 and also 13 are at risk. This Act requires any public body carrying out functions under the Act to haand present), capabilities, background and characteristics. The Act gives local authorities powers to:  carry out medical examinations to determine if an adult at risk has been sexually or physically abused and to determine their competence to make decisions  remove an adult at risk [and not the abuser] from their own home and place them somewhere else where they can be protected  exclude an adult suspected of abusing the adult at risk from their presence for up to six months  even if the adult at risk does not agree with the exclusion. Disabled people are alarmed by the idea of removing the adult at risk, rather than the person suspected, from their own home, which violates their rights to privacy and to private home and family life. In addition, the exclusion of the suspected adult without   5 the consent of the adult considered at risk may be further violation of these rights, and overall creates a prejudice of limited legal capacity.  4.2.2 Disad long-held concerns over existing inaccessibility of s poor staff are now being trained in diversity and equality issues, this needs to be put in place nationally for all prison staff, as disabled people are likely make up a significant , for instance, prisoners with a learning difficulty or learning disability,2 and those with mental health conditions.  4.2.3 The Visiting Committees that regularly visit Scottish prisons unannounced will potentially be dissolved under a UK law to reform public bodies. A Scottish Government Consultation paper3 has examined whether individual monitoring of prisons could be adequately undertaken by HM Inspectorate [of prisons] in addition to [its] existing scrutiny functions. This, the consultation paper argues, would be achieved by merging the functions of visiting Committees with the Inspectorate and removing the Committees as separate entities in a bid to streamline and simplify public bodies.4 visits are much less frequent (currently every 4-5 years, announced), whilst the  meaning their scrutiny function may be more effective. Increasing the number of Inspectorate visits would prove expensive, and Scottish prison authorities would be subject to less regular scrutiny. In the care sector, gaps in such activities by the scrutiny body have led to a culture of bullying. We are concerned about the dangers inherent in this creep towards lack of accountability of the Scottish Prison Service for disabled prisoners.  4.2.4 Disabled people with communication and other access needs related to their impairments have had negative experiences of access to juries. For example, wheelchair users have complained about not being able to access courts following a call and do not meet the right to accessibility. 4.2.5 There needs to be improvement of co-production in all services from central and Scottish Government, and the full realisatiostatutory right for all disabled people to access and benefit from independent advice and advocacy 5                                                            2 Conservative estimates are that we have approximately 1000 prisoners who have a learning disability or borderline learning disability.  3 Forthcoming. 4 Third Force News, 23/5/2011. 5 Independent Living in Scotland    6 4.2.6  that there is no national strategy on advocacy services. The safeguarding of personalization is also needed e.g. in the protection of disabled people against financial and physical abuse. 4.2.7 a quarter of all 6 4.3 Article 16 Freedom from exploitation, violence and abuse 4.3.1 The Campaign for a Fair Society greatly welcomed the recent strengthening of Scottish hate crime law to help protect disabled people from hate crime. In the first year of reporting on hate crime statistics for disabled people in Scotland, 50 cases of crime aggravated by disability were recorded by the Crown office and the Procurator Fiscal. We believe that this does not represent the full experience of exploitation, violence and abuse experienced by disabled people, who, according to a number of recent reports7, are experiencing worsening levels of harassment due to their disability. For example, the disability charity SCOPE recently surveyed its members and found that almost half of respondents felt that attitudes towards them had got worse in the previous year 8 4.3.2 Although disability hate crime has now been recognised in legislation, studies such as those cited above show that there is a lack of awareness of hate crime committed against disabled people, and that many disabled people do not report hate crime, or are not taken seriously when they do. The Campaign for a Fair Society believes that the Scottish Government need to do more work to ensure that people feel confident to report crimes committed against them aggravated by their disability, to issue guidance within the Scottish Justice System on the new aspects of hate crime legislation, and to monitor the implementation and impact of the Offenses (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Act 2009.   4.3.3 In Scotland, there have been reports recently of under-provision of care services for disabled people in receipt of Local Authority services due to a refocusing  he eligibility criteria for care services have been tightened by many local authorities in order to reduce the budget. As well as impacting the right to live independently and be included in the community that such services might support, it leads to inhumane g a person in an incontinence pad or on a chemical toilet in their living room for a full day because they are being left without the support they need.                                                             6 Justice Disability Steering Group  7 -. 8 http://www.scope.org.uk/news/paralympics-attitudes-survey   7 4.3.4 Care is regulated throughout the UK and the Scottish Care Inspectorate is responsible for recent closures of care homes that failed to ensure adequate standards of care. However, recent reports have highlighted a lack of uniformity in the delivery of training within, and patchy regulation and inspection of, care settings. It is unclear how the UK and Scottish Governments promote the training of professionals and staff working with disabled people in the rights recognized in the UNCRPD so as to better provide the assistance and services guaranteed by those rights in care and other settings (e.g. healthtle-viewed as high risk to survival for people who have worked in these settings. Training for staff that work with disabled people is seen as patchy and negatively impacted by local authority procurement strategies (i.e. cheap does not equal quality services). choices are limited to the cheapest options available as quality services are priced out of the market. We are therefore concerned that without effective training that better guarantees compliance with the care standards, that disabled and older people receiving support in their homes or in residential care homes will be subject to neglect and/or abuse.  4.4 Article 19 The right to living independently and being included in the community 4.4.1 Scottish disabled and older people welcomed the introduction of the self-directed support (through direct payments) strategy for the realisation of independent living when it was introduced by the Scottish Government. However, there has been an inconsistent take-up of direct payments and the numbers in receipt of this have not been to target to date. For instance, there is lower uptake amongst mental health service users than for those with more stable conditions and impairments, as mental illnesses and conditions tend to be more variable. Mental health service users have the same rights to this support as others and the Scottish Government therefore needs to do more to encourage uptake and to make renewing SDS easier.   4.4.2 The Social Work Inspection Agency (March 2010) called for to take a more a pro-active approach to promoting di report also observed that individuals opting into the strategy have had inconsistent experiences with its administration and management.9 Disabled people have expressed dissatisfaction relating to decision making by social workers overruling their own wishes; and that the procurement of social and care services for people to eir direct payments have left only options driven by low cost considerations and have reduced the variation in community and social services available, thereby reducing choice and personal freedom.  4.4.3 Although on the face of it, it uses the language of independent living, the proposed assessment for PIP is a functional assessment of disability that does not account for the additional costs associated with disability or the aspirations of                                                            9 http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/03/24113359/4   8 disabled people to independent living. We are concerned that the way the descriptors for the categories are currently planned would relegate the right to independent living, rather than realise it, as people become poorer and more In addition, the reform to PIP will remove mobility allowance from adults living in residential care, which will drastically curtail their mobility and thus participation in family life and in society in general. The Scottish Campaign for a Fair Society would like to see the welfare reform bill amended to allow adults living in residential care homes to continue to claim the mobility component of PIP.  4.4.4 Cuts to public services run by local authorities along with the new caps on local housing allowance are having the effect of reducing autonomy, as disabled people and their families lose access to essential local services that drive participation in society and the economy. They simultaneously have less real income due to the housing benefit caps to payments introduced in April 2011. 4.4.5 The current inability of Scots disabled people that disabled peoplchoose their place of residence and where and with whom they live on an equal basis with others and are not obliged to live in a particular liv 10 Lack of portability of care also right to respect for the home and the family (article 23). Being subject to varying funding depending on your Local Authority can result in restricted access to accessible housing. 4.5 Article 21 The right to freedom of expression and opinion and the right to information 4.5.1 There are several policy areas in which accessible communication may be denied to disabled people, the consequences of which have the potential to impact on a much wider range of rights than that of access to information contained within Article 21.  4.5.2 In the drafting of policy, the accessibility of information for consultation is crucial to realising the right to accessibility to information (articles 9; 21). A few good practice initiatives cannot make up for the lack of information available in other areas. For example, some Government information leaflets - e.g. for the National Conversation  - still routinely ignore existing guidance on accessible information, and the NHS is still communicating with blind people in inappropriate formats.11 Such examples impact on a number of other rights, such as respect for privacy as articulated in article 22, and the rights contained within articles 17 (protecting integrity of the person), and 19 (living independently within the community). In other examples, the Office for Disability Issues was unable to provide accessible word                                                            10 Independent Living in Scotland (IL-10.  11 Towards an inclusive health service: a report into the availability of health information for blind and  Dr Foster Intelligence for RNIB.    9 format (for screenreaders) of its draft report on the UN Convention on the Rights of Disabled People (UNCRPD) when it consulted the public on that; and the Department for Work and Pensions did not have an easy read format of the initial draft of the assessment criteria for PIP during an informal consultation this summer. On request from Quarriers and others, this was hurriedly put together only 2 weeks before the end of the consultation period which put people with learning difficulties at a distinct disadvantage, as other formats had been available for the full 3 month period. The Scottish Campaign for a Fair Society wants the Scottish and UK Governments to firmly commit to producing all publications in accessible formats for people with a range of impairments.   4.5.3 The Patients Rights (Scotland) Act (2011) addresses the right to Equal recognition before the law, which is laudable, but within the Act NHS staff only need request to be ignored, the accessibility to advice and support to disabled patients would be severely curtailed and their right to access to information would be infringed under this law. We recommend that secondary legislation is put in place to make this mandatory in recognition of this right.  4.5.4 The code of practice accompanying the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act (2007) (discussed above in section 4.2.1) has the potential to undermine Section 8(2) of this same Act, which provides that an adult at risk is not required to answer any questions at interviews, and that the adult must be informed of that fact before the interview commences. It does this by stating that requirements of the adult for BSL, translation, or documents to be made available in accessible formats (e.g. into Braille, easy read, or audio formats) only have to be considered by the local authority. If a decision not to meet these requirements based on e.g. cost resulted in the adult at risk or the officer not being able to understand the communication of their right to refuse to be interviewed, a clear transgression of the rights contained in article 21 (to freedom of expression and opinion, and access to information), and also to the rights to equal recognition in the law and legal capacity in article 12 will take place. The code of practice needs to be rewritten to ensure that the communication needs of the adult at risk are addressed before informing them of their right not to answer questions. 4.6 Article 23 Adequate Standard of Living and Social Protection 4.6.1 The  replacement for Disability Living Allowance (PIP) aims to cut the amount of PIP paid overall by 20%, but it is likely that many more than 20% of disabled people may be subject to loss of DLA/PIP because changes are currently only being applied to working age adults, the proposed assessment for eligibility will make it harder to qualify for the new benefit, and change from three to two main rates of payment will automatically remove a significant proportion of recipients. The majority of people in receipt of the lower rate of care which will be removed have either a learning difficulty, a mental health condition or a cognitive impairment (e.g. autism).   10 People will be further disadvantaged if they lose the mobility component as this will also mean that they lose e.g. travel passes. 4.6.2 The experience of Work Capability Assessments (for ESA) have been medical rather than holistic, with a focus on getting people to work in a recession when there are fewer jobs available. The assessment was judged to be flawed by an independent review led by Professor Malcolm Harrington. For example, many IB claimants who have been assessed for the new benefit have had it removed and in spite of suffering conditions such as cancer, or, due to their impairment/ condition, having to receive significant levels of personal care and support throughout the day to manage it. At least a third of disabled people currently live in poverty and only 50% are in employment (compared to 80% of non-disabled people). Proposals in the current Welfare Reform bill will time limit receipt of contributory ESA to 12 months, in spite of the Department for Work and Pensions the benefit will need the support for longer than 12 months.    4.6.3 The impact of caps to Local Housing Benefit recently introduced has been assessed by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. It found that claimants will be on average £11 a week worse off. Using Department for Work and Pensions Statistics, Inclusion Scotland have estimated that at least 62,000 households containing a disabled person will lose up to £15 pw in housing benefit.  Given that a sizeable minority of disabled people live in specialist housing provided by housing associations, it is likely that they will face these additional costs, and disabled peoples organisations are concerned that the extra payment on additional bedrooms proposed in the current Welfare Reform bill will unfairly impact disabled tenants who have spare rooms for storing equipment and/or for occasional use of by a carer.  4.6.4 Care charges (falling under the ) The guidance available to local authorities in England allows disabled people to retain more of their income when care charges are being assessed. The current care charging guidance in Scotland, taken together with the recent cuts to the Independent Living Fund (ILF), have reduced the income of some disabled people in and out of employment to below Income Support levels (after housing costs, travel to work, etc. are taken into account). The Scottish Campaign for a Fair Society would like the Scottish Government to review legislation allowing Scottish Local Authorities to charge for care, and to remove the charges to disabled people, as we view the charges as a tax on disability. In addition to Council Tax, people are not charged an additional fee to enter libraries or to send their children to the local state school.    4.6.5 The rate of poverty in the UK for families with disabled children is already high: in ten disabled children live in poverty   11 (325,000) UK wide.12 This picture is set to worsen once the welfare reform bill is passed. Inclusion Scotland predicts that families with a disabled child will lose over £3,000 each by 2015 due to cuts in disability premiums and the proposed cap on benefits.  4.7 Article 24 The right to Education 4.7.1 There is a list of rights that cannot be realised without the right to education as ling persons with disabilities to 13 and which are key to the principles of independent living.  4.7.2 Whilst the Scottish Campaign for a Fair Society welcomes the More Choices, More Chances scheme adopted by the Scottish Government, which potentially increases access to education for young people who have limited access to education, employment or training14, we would now like the Scottish Government to provide the details of how it is being monitored and evaluated, and thus its impact so far.  4.7.3 Children with learning difficulties are labelled as having behaviour problems because teachers do not know how to deal with them. Currently, as in the rest of the UK, disability equality training - which might give the teachers the skills and knowledge to address such issues - is not a mandatory part of training of teachers and other educators in Scotland. We find this unacceptable if the Scottish Government is to realise its commitment to GIRFEC, and to article 24. We would trained to provide the right additional support for children and young people with learning difficulties 15 Mainstreaming is also needed for disabled children so that they have the equal opportunity to learn according to the national curriculum, and also so that they can make friends with non-disabled children. 4.7.4 Deaf children should have the opportunity to continue to learn and use British Sign language (BSL) at school  learning BSL should be looked on as a valued social skill for all children. Deaf children should also be given the opportunity for social interaction with other deaf children as part of their culture.  4.7.5 The closure of the Independent Living Fund to new applicants in Scotland will have an education, and will thus impact on their employability. The Scottish Government should ensure that young disabled people have full access to funding to cover the                                                            12 http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/news-views/press-release/four-ten-disabled-children-are-living-poverty 13 UN CRPD p. 16 http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/convention/convoptprot-e.pdf 14 point 197, p.69. 15 See to the Scottish Parliament lodge in September 2011, available here here:  http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/S4_PublicPetitionsCommittee/Petitions/PE1409_Petition_Template_Final_Version.pdf   12 additional costs of accessing further education where this fund has been removed, and should review a programme of this type in relation to its programme of preventative spending. 4.7.6 This is taking place against a backdrop of reducing part time courses for learning disabled adults at further education colleges. This year, the Scottish part-time courses for people with learning disabilities have been cut by more than a third and most students had very little notice that their college place was being cu16 4.7.7 The Scottish Government has set out an ambitious vision  all 16-19 year olds will have a place in post 16 education and training and support appropriate to their needs. It remains unclear how the needs of young adults with learning disabilities are to be promoted in the implementation of this plan. We would welcome further guidance on this by the Scottish Government, co-produced by young learning disabled school leavers and their families and carers, who will also be impacted by cuts to college places outlined in point 4.7.6 above.  4.8 Article 25 Health 4.8.1 Whilst we welcome the publication by the Scottish Government of  (Fair for All-Disability 200617), which provides service providers to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people in accessing goods, fac unclear what  the Scottish Government has been doing to review whether or not the guidance is being followed in practice. We recommend that this is followed up and reviewed, or monitored via Equality Impact Assessments required under the Equality Act (2010).   4.8.2 The equality training (NES) for post-graduate medical professionals in receipt of specialist medical training is limited, and a broader disability equality training for medical professionals and staff who inevitably regularly come into contact with disabled people should be delivered as a matter of course. An improvement in this provision might bypass the denial of rights experienced in examples given above (and in 4.5).  4.8.3 The UK Government states that the Rehabilitation (2007) is implemented by employing a rehabilitation co-ordinator in almostis added) every health board. It is a post-code lottery on how adult rehabilitation for people with long-term conditions is met and monitored, and inconsistency may impact on the realisation of other rights.  4.8.4 In addition, the management of rehabilitation is seen as lacking. The experience of the multidisciplinary and multiagency care management run by NHS Scotland is felt by                                                            16 http://www.scld.org.uk/sites/default/files/scld_joint_briefing_final.pdf 17 http://www.healthscotland.com/documents/1982.aspx   13 disabled people to be poor beyond discharge. We recommend monitoring of discharge plans and follow up with patients. need to focus more on the social barriers to rehabilitation, as well as the medical ones.  4.8.5 We have been very concerned about children with conditions such as ADHD and for adults in residential care. This practice needs to be investigated by the UK government and the NHS, and checks need to be put in place that more appropriate therapies for behavioural disorders are considered and used, and that such drugs are only ever used in extremely exceptional circumstances.  4.9 Article 27 Work and employment 4.9.1 The additional stress and burden that the removal of benefits to disabled claimants - through work capability assessments and the reform of DLA - is causing increasing distress to disabled people, particularly in a time of job shortages caused by the banking crisis in 2008 and the ensuing recession. Add to this unhelpful comments made by ministers about the minimum wage, and false reporting by some onal media on benefits fraud amongst this group, and it is easy to see how a high level of stigma and increase of harassment is being experienced by a large proportion of working age disabled adults who cannot currently work due to sickness or disability, and thus claim benefits.  4.9.2 Whilst the employability rate for disabled adults is almost 50%, for groups with particular conditions and impairments, this rate is much higher. For instance, Scottish Consortium for Learning Disabilities (SCLD) reports that 86% of learning disabled adults in Scotland are unemployed.18 The SCLD has also found that only 3% of people with learning difficulties and individuals on the autistic spectrum work 16 hrs + (the level of hours needed to ensure earnings do not fall below levels of poverty). The rate of unemployment for people with long lasting mental health problems is 79%.19 We recognise a number of issues prevent these groups from working, such as stigma, discrimination, low expectations and lack of support. However, as more and more disabled people are being transferred from Incapacity Scottish and UK Governments must encourage employers to recognise and fulfil their responsibilities, including improving support and advice for employers, and encouraging disability equality training among staff teams. The UK Government needs to raise awareness of the existence of Access to Work funding for adaptations, and other such support for employers. We  National Framework for Supported Employment,20 published in 2010. However, there has been no legislation to underpin this guidance, and without legislation Local Authorities have largely ignored the recommendations in this document.                                                             18 http://www.heraldscotland.com/life-style/real-lives/still-a-big-job-to-do-1.1111481 19 Scottish Government 2005 Disability and Employment in Scotland: review of evidence base. 20 http://www.viascotland.org.uk/publications/a-working-life-for-all-disabled-people   14 4.9.3 The situation of low employment for disabled people is not improved by a raft of measures to remove benefits from those who work or aspire to work, and is further eroded by the recent experiences of disabled people in employment regarding ages by the DWP, during which disabled people have reported that assessors have treated them as if they were committing fraud.    4.9.4 ould (but currently do not) lead by example by employing more disabled people. Consideration also needs to be given to making it a requirement for companies tendering for government contracts to show evidence of disability awareness including employing disabled people.   15  5. Concluding Comments 5.1 A general concern amongst disabled people is that without access to justice and proper awareness raising, conventions such as this are of limited use in terms of achieving human rights realisation/ preventing further rights violations in the UK. There is little available to disabled people in the way of national action plans for implementation of human rights, and therefore the scope of monitoring and evaluating them is limited. We would like to see the Scottish Government do more to ensure that disabled people have equal access to services and benefits that will assist them to live independently, have access to health care and education and employment opportunities, and are free to live their lives free from abuse and poverty. This is more important than ever at this time as the UK government introduce cuts to essential benefits that cover the additional costs incurred by disability.   5.2 Our submission to the Human Rights Council contains a number of issues and recommendations that we believe should be prioritised by the Scottish and UK governments. The Scottish Campaign for a Fair Society therefore urges the Human Rights Council to make these recommendations to the relevant governments so that work can be done to achieve human rights and equality for disabled and older people.                                                               i Further information For more information on this submission, please contact Dr Pauline Nolan, Policy and Engagement Officer at Inclusion Scotland, on 0141 221 7589 or at pauline@inclusionscotland.org.uk, or at the address below: Inclusion Scotland Unit 219, 36-28 Washington Street, Glasgow,  G3 8AZ.

61,SCID - Scottish Campaign Against Irresponsible Drivers,"S.C.I.D. Supporting Victims of Road Crashes  1  Universal Periodic Review  On behalf of SCID I would like to submit the following information to be considered in the next iversal Periodic Review in 2012.   It may be helpful to provide a brief background on SCID.  SCID, (Scottish Campaign against Irresponsible Drivers) was formed in 1985 by Wendy Moss as a result of a fatal road crash in which her only son was killed. Since that time SCID has helped and advised hundreds of Scottish families who have lost a loved one as a result of a road crash.  SCID Objectives:   To help and advise victim families of road crashes  To seek to restructure the Law as it applies to Criminal Traffic Offences which have caused death    or injury   To deter irresponsible drivers by the imposition of more relevant sanctions   To encourage drivers, through education, to adopt safer standards.  Contact details: Mrs Margaret Dekker SCID Researcher/secretary    Tel No: 01236 610234  e-mail: SCID@blueyonder.co.uk  The World Health Organisation1 has statedpublic health and injury prevention problems. The problem is all the more acute because the victims are overwhelmingly healthy   Absence of Human Rights 1. Victims seriously injured by criminal driving offenders denied recognition in law. 2. Victim families bereaved by road crashes and victims injured in road crashes denied access to police reports. 1http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs358/en/    S.C.I.D. Supporting Victims of Road Crashes  2  1. Victims seriously injured by criminal driving offenders denied recognition in law. Serious injury has life changing effects on victims and their families and yet these road crash victims in Scotland, England & Wales are not treated as victims of crime, even when the law has been broken. While data is collected on the number of offenders who have killed innocent road users by criminal driving offences, in Scotland, England & Wales there is no data collected on the number of victims serious injured by culpable drivers; as there is no criminal driving offence which takes into account serious injury.  The Road Traffic Act is a UK Act reserved to Westminster, yet in Northern Ireland there are criminal driving offences which do take into account the consequences of serious injury.  Comparison of Legislation  Scotland, England & Wales  Northern Ireland2  Causing Death by Dangerous Driving Section 1 RTA 1998  Causing Death or Grievous Bodily Injury by Dangerous Driving  Causing Death by Careless Driving when under the Influence of Drink or Drugs Section 3A RTA 1998  Causing Death or Grievous Bodily Injury by Careless Driving when under the Influence of Drink or Drugs   Causing Death by Careless Driving Section 2B of RTA 1998  Causing Death or Grievous Bodily Injury by Careless Driving   Causing Death by Driving whilst unlicensed, uninsured or Disqualified Section 3ZB RTA 1998   Causing Death or Grievous Bodily Injury by Driving whilst unlicensed, uninsured or Disqualified   Aggravated Vehicle-taking Causing Death (England & Wales Only)  Aggravated Vehicle-taking Causing Death or Grievous Bodily Injury  2 Public Prosecution Policy for Northern Ireland - Road Traffic Policy       http://www.ppsni.gov.uk/Site/1/Documents/PPS%20Press%20Office/PPSNI%20TRAFFIC.pdf  S.C.I.D. Supporting Victims of Road Crashes  3   An announcement on the 7th October 2011 by The Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke QC MP, Secretary of State for Justice, outlined a proposed new offence, with increased penalties, of causing grievous bodily harm (or severe physical injury in Scotland) by dangerous driving.  The rationale behind this announcement was that a victim can receive very serious injuries just short of death and the existing dangerous driving offence (Section 2 of the RTA) cannot take into account the consequences of serious injury in sentencing.   Although this is a welcome development, it also gives cause for great concern. The proposed new charge recognises the consequences of dangerous driving but in doing so discriminates against those victims who suffer grievous bodily harm or severe physical injury by other criminal driving offences.   By way of example; in Scotland, England & Wales if a driver drives carelessly and kills an innocent road user then the judiciary can, since August 2008, take into account the standard of driving and the consequences of death in sentencing. However if a driver drives carelessly and seriously injures an innocent road user then the judiciary can only take into account the standard of driving and not the consequences.  Innocent victims seriously injured in road crashes in Scotland and England & Wales have their right to life less well protected than those seriously injured in Northern Ireland.   2. Victim families bereaved by road crashes and victims injured in road crashes denied access to police reports. A road death is an indiscriminate death, it is a sudden death, it is a violent death and it is a premature death, and where there is culpability the effect on a bereaved family can only be compared with a homicide. Many families in seeking answers to their questions ask for sight of the police reports only to be denied. This in turn leads families to believe, rightly or wrongly, there is something to hide and alienates these law abiding citizens from the Criminal Justice System they looked to for support.   S.C.I.D. Supporting Victims of Road Crashes  4  Part of the grieving process is access to information. The information bereaved families may want to access can range from very basic information about the investigation into their loved ones death, to very detailed information.   Human Rights3 and Freedom of Information are intrinsically linked. The FOISA publication scheme for Scottish police forces states We are committed to openness and transparency in the provision of services to the public, and it is our intention to publish as much information as possible on subjects where there is known to be public interest and where the disclosure of that information would be both lawful and appropriate yet , at the conclusion of an investigation or criminal proceedings, is invariably denied.    The police are a public body run wit considerable power over the lives of members of the public. The information victim families seek is not about state security, drug cartels or the like it is about families having access to as much information as possible which in turn aids their understanding and aids the grieving process in the weeks, months and years ahead.  To deny bereaved families the right to access this information leaves a long lasting aggravated grief from which they never recover.   At the end of an investigation or at the end of criminal proceedings a family should have the right to access information in the police report if they so wish.   3DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL - Establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime. http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/criminal/victims/docs/com_2011_275_en.pdf  7th November 2011    ",english,"s.c.i.d. support victim road crash univers period review behalf scid would like submit follow inform consid next ivers period review may help provid brief background scid scid scottish campaign irrespons driver form wendi moss result fatal road crash son kill sinc time scid help advis hundr scottish famili lost love one result road crash scid object help advis victim famili road crash seek restructur law appli crimin traffic offenc caus death injuri deter irrespons driver imposit relev sanction encourag driver educ adopt safer standard contact detail mrs margaret dekker scid research secretari tel e mail scid co uk world health organisation1 statedpubl health injuri prevent problem problem acut victim overwhelm healthi absenc human right victim serious injur crimin drive offend deni recognit law victim famili bereav road crash victim injur road crash deni access polic report s.c.i.d. support victim road crash victim serious injur crimin drive offend deni recognit law serious injuri life chang effect victim famili yet road crash victim scotland england wale treat victim crime even law broken data collect number offend kill innoc road user crimin drive offenc scotland england wale data collect number victim serious injur culpabl driver crimin drive offenc take account serious injuri road traffic act uk act reserv westminst yet northern ireland crimin drive offenc take account consequ serious injuri comparison legisl scotland england wale northern ireland2 caus death danger drive section rta caus death grievous bodili injuri danger drive caus death careless drive influenc drink drug section rta caus death grievous bodili injuri careless drive influenc drink drug caus death careless drive section b rta caus death grievous bodili injuri careless drive caus death drive whilst unlicens uninsur disqualifi section zb rta caus death grievous bodili injuri drive whilst unlicens uninsur disqualifi aggrav vehicl take caus death england wale aggrav vehicl take caus death grievous bodili injuri public prosecut polici northern ireland road traffic polici s.c.i.d. support victim road crash announc th octob rt hon kenneth clark qc mp secretari state justic outlin propos new offenc increas penalti caus grievous bodili harm sever physic injuri scotland danger drive rational behind announc victim receiv serious injuri short death exist danger drive offenc section rta cannot take account consequ serious injuri sentenc although welcom develop also give caus great concern propos new charg recognis consequ danger drive discrimin victim suffer grievous bodili harm sever physic injuri crimin drive offenc way exampl scotland england wale driver drive careless kill innoc road user judiciari sinc august 2008, take account standard drive consequ death sentenc howev driver drive careless serious injur innoc road user judiciari take account standard drive consequ innoc victim serious injur road crash scotland england wale right life less well protect serious injur northern ireland victim famili bereav road crash victim injur road crash deni access polic report road death indiscrimin death sudden death violent death prematur death culpabl effect bereav famili compar homicid mani famili seek answer question ask sight polic report deni turn lead famili believ right wrong someth hide alien law abid citizen crimin justic system look support s.c.i.d. support victim road crash part griev process access inform inform bereav famili may want access rang basic inform investig love one death detail inform human rights3 freedom inform intrins link foisa public scheme scottish polic forc state commit open transpar provis servic public intent publish much inform possibl subject known public interest disclosur inform would law appropri yet conclus investig crimin proceed invari deni polic public bodi run wit consider power live member public inform victim famili seek state secur drug cartel like famili access much inform possibl turn aid understand aid griev process week month year ahead deni bereav famili right access inform leav long last aggrav grief never recov end investig end crimin proceed famili right access inform polic report wish direct european parliament council establish minimum standard right support protect victim crime th novemb"
62,SCLD - Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability,"Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability     Submission for UPR United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  1       Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability (SCLD) www.scld.org.uk  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  Submission to the United Nations Universal Periodic Review  13th Session of the Working Group on the UPR Human Rights Council May/June 2012 Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability  The Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability (SCLD) is a registered charity and is the  learning disability.  SCLD was founded in 2001 following a policy on people with learning disabilities.  people with learning disabilities and their families should be able to have a good life, like anyone else.  Our mission is to work in partnership with people with learning disabilities of all ages as well as family carers to challenge discrimination and to develop and share good practice.  Our goal is an inclusive Scotland where everyone is valued and respected for who they are and what they contribute as equal citizens.  SCLD undertakes training, consultancy and research as well as disseminating information for and about people with learning disabilities.  We also support the National Development Team for Local Area Co-ordination and undertake the annual collection of data on people with learning disabilities in Scotland, the eSAY statistics.  SCLD has 12 partner organisations: Association for Real Change (ARC) Scotland, Badaguish Outdoor Centre, British Institute for Learning Disabilities, Capability, Central Advocacy Partners,  Scotland, ENABLE Scotland, PAMIS, Key, University of Dundee, University of Glasgow and University of St Andrews.Chloë Trew, chloe.t@scld.co.uk Research and Policy Officer SCLD Room 16 Adelphi Centre Glasgow, G5 OPQ 0044 141 418 5420  Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability     Submission for UPR United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  2   Executive Summary  1. SCLD welcomes the signature and ratification of the UNCRPD and its Optional Protocol and urges both the United Kingdom and Scottish Governments to continue to work towards its full implementation. 2. SCLD urges the Scottish Government to work with relevant stakeholders to resolve the issue of indefinite welfare guardianship orders placed on people with learning disabilities. 3. SCLD urges both the UK and the Scottish Governments to tackle the issue of hate crime towards disabled people, including people with learning disabilities. 4. SCLD urges the Scottish Government to continue its work in making the criminal justice system fairer for both victims of crime and offenders who have learning disabilities.  Prisoners with learning disabilities must be supported comprehensively by social, housing and employment services upon leaving prison. 5. SCLD urges the UK and Scottish Governments to recognize the progress which has been made towards independent living and that disabled people often require support to achieve this.  Cutting support services and benefits which help disabled people to be part of society, to undertake self-care, to work, to travel and to make friends will be detrimental to the realization of the rights of disabled people. Background  1. The information contained in this report comes from a variety of sources, such information gathered through literature review, or research reports conducted by SCLD, our Partners or relevant stakeholder organisations.  This includes recent research undertaken of implementation, which featured an extensive literature review and interviews with 50 people with learning disabilities and 51 family carers across Scotland. Framework  2. The Scottish Government is the administration responsible for those policy areas which are not reserved to the UK Government at Westminster, which include policing, health and social care policy.  The Scottish Government is bound by the obligations set out in those United Nations treaties which have been signed and ratified by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK).  In  Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability     Submission for UPR United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  3  addition, people with learning disabilities in Scotland enjoy the protection of the European Convention on Human Rights incorporated into domestic law through the Human Rights Act (1998).  3. The Scottish Parliament is empowered by the Scotland Act (1998) to make laws for Scotland on matters which are not reserved, providing that these are compatible with the Human Rights Act (1998).  It should be noted that Scotland has a distinct legal system.    Progress since 2008 UPR UK  4. SCLD is concerned that none of the recommendations made to the United Kingdom during 2008 UPR UK related to disabled people, including people with learning disabilities.  While recognising that people with learning disabilities in Scotland enjoy the protection of all United Nations human rights treaties signed and ratified by the UK, we are concerned that disabled people, including people with learning disabilities have been forgotten.  This is despite the fact that people with learning disabilities in Scotland are more likely to live in poverty, to be unemployed, to experience discrimination, to be denied choice and autonomy, to be subject to hate crime, abuse and assault and sadly even to experience cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  People with learning disabilities often depend on services provided or contracted by government bodies to a much greater extent than people in the general population, meaning that the safeguards provided by human rights law are particularly important to this group of individuals.  Therefore, SCLD particularly welcomes the signature and ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and its Optional Protocol by the UK and urges both the UK Government and the Scottish Government to continue towards the full implementation of the UNCRPD.  5. Tional Human Rights Institution, was founded in 2008 and has a general duty to promote awareness, understanding and respect for all human rights - economic, social, political, cultural and civil - to everyone, everywhere in Scotland, and to encourage best practice in relation to human rights.1  SCLD welcomes the focus on human rights which the has provided.  In particular, SCLD notes the emphasis which the                                       1 Please see http://www.scottishhumanrights.com/about/what  Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability     Submission for UPR United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  4  Commission has placed upon the rights and dignity of people who use care and support services.  6. SCLD has collected data from local authorities about people with learning disabilities on an annual basis since 2008.  The eSAY statistics assist the Scottish Government and Scottish Local Authorities in policy making and provide an indicator of the implementation progress needs to be made in realizing economic, social and cultural rights.  For example, the eSAY statistics show that only 14% of people with learning disabilities known to services are currently in employment or work placements.2  This is a much lower proportion than that of the general population or other disabled people. Implementation of International Human Rights Obligations  7. SCLD recognizes that people with learning disabilities in Scotland enjoy the protection of the United Nations human rights treaties to which the UK is a party.  Since the UNCRPD contextualises and tailors international human rights obligations to disabled people, we have chosen to focus most of our response on the obligations set out therein.  Article 9 UNCRPD - Accessibility  8. In order to be included and participate in the community, people with profound and multiple learning disability or complex health needs may require the use of a Changing Places Toilet.  This is a toilet which is fully accessible and includes the right equipment as well as enough space for the person and their carers or support workers.  At present there are 61 Changing Places Toilets in Scotland.  SCLD welcomes the progress which has been made on this issue.  However, there remain entire Local Authority areas which do not have Changing Places Toilets or very large areas in which there may only be one or two Changing Places Toilets.  This seriously limits the ability of people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and their family carers to get out and about and participate fully in their communities and Scottish society.  SCLD urges the Scottish Government and public authorities in Scotland to increase the coverage of Changing Places Toilets.                                       2 Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability, 2011, Statistics Release: Adults with learning disabilities - , Glasgow: Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability http://www.scld.org.uk/scld-projects/esay/publications-and-resources/statistics-releases  Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability     Submission for UPR United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  5   9. People with learning disabilities are not always able to obtain accessible information about issues which are important to them.  For example, plain English and/or easy read information is not routinely available for people with learning disabilities, despite the fact that the most recent Scottish Social Attitudes Survey found that 93% of people felt that the production of such information was a good use of public money.3 SCLD would urge all government departments and public authorities who provide information to members of the public to ensure that accessible information is available for people with learning disabilities.  This may require investment in workforce capacity so that public sector workers and workers in other relevant agencies have the skills necessary to produce good quality accessible information for people with learning disabilities.  We would also remind public authorities that people with learning disabilities and people on the autism spectrum may also have sensory impairments and therefore require information in other formats, such as Large Print, Braille or British Sign Language.  Article 12 UNCRPD - Equal Recognition before the Law Article 13 UNCRPD - Access to Justice  10. In Scotland, the Adults with Incapacity Act (Scotland) 2000 is designed to regulate the way in which decisions are made for individuals who do not have the capacity to make decisions for themselves in important issues such as their personal welfare, their property, their financial affairs or any medical treatment which they may require.4  People covered by the Act are those over the age of 16 who cannot act or make, communicate, understand or remember their decisions.  One feature of the Act is that it permits the issuing of intervention or guardianship orders for adults who lack capacity.  An intervention order is typically used where a discrete, one-off decision is required; a guardianship order permits the appointed guardian to make financial and welfare decisions over the longer term.  Guardianship orders typically last for 3 years, however, the Sheriff has discretion to shorten or lengthen them as required.                                          3Ormston et al, 2011, Scottish Social Attitudes Survey 2010: Attitudes to Discrimination and Positive Action, Edinburgh: Scottish Government http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/355716/0120166.pdf 4 Please see Patrick, H, Smith, N (2009).  Adult Protection and the Law in Scotland, Haywards Heath: Bloomsbury Professional   Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability     Submission for UPR United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  6  11. The AWI is underpinned by a number of important principles which speak to human right values, including a presumption in favour of capacity; that any actions taken should be for the benefit of the adult concerned and should be the least restrictive option possible; that the person in question and, that the views of significant people in their life are also respected.  However, recent reports of the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland (MWC Scotland), which is responsible for monitoring the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 and welfare guardianship under the AWI, have shown that Sheriffs are granting indefinite welfare guardianship orders on people with learning disabilities, including upon young people with learning disabilities.  Furthermore, private applicants are seeking indefinite orders at a much higher rate than local authorities.  This is closely bound up with issues relating to consent to medical treatment.  The Chief Executive of the MWC Scotland has raised the issue continually in his advice notes, the most recent published in November 2011, in which he states:  We remain concerned about the practice of applying for indefinite welfare guardianship for young adults.  Our concerns are greatest where the powers sought are wide-ranging and do not appear tailored to the individual person's needs.  Practitioners should remember that there is no automatic judicial review of indefinite welfare guardianship.  We have already expressed concerns that restrictive powers, exercised indefinitely without review by a court or tribunal, may not be compatible with human rights legislation.  We recommend applying for time limited periods.5  12. To be placed under a welfare guardianship order represents a serious infringement into the choice, autonomy and privacy of a human being. It is critical that welfare guardianship orders are both addition, that safeguards such as review are built in.  SCLD is concerned that indefinite welfare guardianship orders, especially when applied to young adults with learning disabilities, may infringe Article 12 (4) of the UNCRPD, since they may not be proportional to the and are not subject to review by a competent, independent, impartial authority or judicial body. SCLD urges the Scottish Government to work in partnership with the MWC Scotland, the Scottish Human                                       5 Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, Chief Executive Advice Note , Issue 4, http://www.mwcscot.org.uk/bulletins/Chief_Executive_Advice_Note_June2011.asp  Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability     Submission for UPR United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  7  Rights Commission, the judiciary, people with learning disabilities and family carers to resolve this issue satisfactorily, potentially by time-limiting welfare guardianship orders or requiring regular review. SCLD understands that the Scottish Law Reform Commission is undertaking a review of the AWI and welcomes the news that it will consider this issue.  13. The Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Act 2009 (OABPS) came into force in 2010.  The OABPS provides that where it can be shown that an offence was aggravated by malice or ill will towards someone because of their disability or perceived disability, the court must state this on conviction, record this on conviction and take the aggravation into account when sentencing.  SCLD welcomes this development but notes that only 50 cases of disablist hate crime were reported in the first year of operation the OABPS, compared to more than 4,000 cases of racially motivated hate crime.6  Government statistics have shown that around 17% of disabled people have experienced hate crime in Scotland7 but other research shows that the rate may be much higher.8  On the basis of the eSAY statistics, it could be expected that at least 4,500 people in with learning disabilities in Scotland have experienced hate crime.  Figures from a recent Scottish Government summit on adults with learning disabilities in the criminal justice system show that 73% of people with learning disability have experienced discrimination; 35% have been physically assaulted; 40% have reported incidents to the police; 90% have told other people of incidents; 25% have been forced to move home because of harassment; and 63% report feeling frightened.9  Recent research by the Equality and Human Rights Commission shows that hate crime towards disabled people is a significant and ongoing issue. The Hidden in Plain Sight10 report documented two cases of serious assault and/or murder of people with learning disabilities in Scotland.                                       6 Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, 2011, Hate Crime in Scotland 2010-2011, Edinburgh: Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, available at http://www.copfs.gov.uk/News/Releases/2011/05/Hate-Crime-Scotland-2010-11 7 Equality and Human Rights Commission, 2011, Hidden in Plain Sight: Inquiry into Disability Related Harassment, Equality and Human Rights Commission, see page 58. http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/legal-and-policy/inquiries-and-assessments/inquiry-into-disability-related-harassment/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-inquiry-final-report/ 8 Disability Rights Commission and Capability Scotland, 2004, Hate Crime Against Disabled People in Scotland: A Survey Report,  Disability Rights Commission, http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/DRC/Hate%20Crime%20report.pdf 9 Scottish Government, 2009, Adults with Learning Disabilities and the Criminal Justice System, Edinburgh: The Stationery Office.  Statistics come from Disability Rights Commission and Capability Scotland, 2004, Hate Crime Against Disabled People in Scotland: A Survey Report,  Disability Rights Commission 10 Please see note 7.  Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability     Submission for UPR United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  8  The report recommends that there should be greater ownership of the issue, improved data collection, a more accessible criminal justice system and better recognition of hate crime by the police and other agencies.  SCLD urges the Scottish Government and other public authorities to implement these recommendations as a matter of urgency.  14. SCLD is also concerned about the rights of prisoners with learning disabilities.  Recent research by the Prison Reform Trust11 and some preliminary research by us on this problem shows that learning disability is largely unrecognised and that as a result, many of the programmes aimed at rehabilitation and parole of prisoners with learning disabilities are not accessible.  This can have the effect of disadvantaging and further disenfranchising this group of individuals.  Moreover, appropriate throughcare services may not be being offered or put in place to support prisoners with learning disabilities on leaving prison, putting them at significant risk of homelessness, addiction and hate crime.  Article 19 UNCRPD  Living independently  15. Article 19 of the UNCRPD provides that disabled people should be able to live independently and stresses their full inclusion and participation in the community.  SCLD welcomes the fact that the Independent Living in Scotland project is central to the Scottish and recognizes the significant progress which has been made towards this for people with learning long-stay learning disability hospitals.  However, to achieve independent living and inclusion, people with learning disabilities often need support, whether this is financial or from support staff.  Removing this support - whether this takes the form of cuts to care packages by Local Authorities or cuts to UK wide benefits such as the Disability Living Allowance - will significantly constrain the ability of people to live independently and to participate in their communities.  There is often a very narrow margin between being able to live independently and being excluded and isolated.  For example, by removing the support hours a person with learning disabilities may need to help them travel, that person is then effectively unable to get to work or college, with detrimental effects on their finances, self-                                      11 Loucks, N, 2007, No One Knows: Offenders with Learning Difficulties and Learning Disabilities - Review of Prevalence and Associated Need, London: Prison Reform Trust  Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability     Submission for UPR United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  9  esteem and inclusion.  On the contrary, investing in properly supporting people with learning disabilities prevents crisis in the long term and enables the realization of their human rights.  Article 29 Participation  16. Recent campaigns run bConsortium Partner, Capability, have shown that participating in elections, one of the fundamental rights of a citizen in a democratic society, is problematic for people with learning disabilities due to a lack of accessible information, inaccessible polling stations and ballot papers. 12  Furthermore, some political parties in Scotland failed to produce an easy read version of their manifesto until 2 weeks before the election, which meant that people with learning disabilities were not able to participate fully in the democratic process.  Other issues of concern  17. There are a number of other significant signs of progress and issues of concern in the realization of the rights of people with learning disabilities in Scotland which have not been mentioned here due to space constraints.  These include:   the coming into force of the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act 2007 in October 2008;   the rights to liberty and security of adults with learning disabilities, particularly where the adult may fall under the protection of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act (2000);   the rights of parents with learning disabilities in Scotland;13   the rights to an adequate standard of living and social protection;   new forms of institutionalisation as well as the obligations and responsibilities of private actors to promote and protect the rights of people with learning disabilities.  This is particularly in light of the footage filmed by the BBC at Winterbourne View, a                                       12 Scope, 2010.

The treatment at the unit has the potential to engage UNCRPD Article 15 rights as well as rights under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) to which the UK is a party;   the higher rate of gender based violence towards children and adults, particularly women with learning disabilities; and   the rights of offenders with learning disabilities diverted from the criminal justice system and detained instead under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.14  SCLD would be happy to discuss any of the issues mentioned in this report in further detail.  2,808 words excluding foot notes and cover page.                                       14 People First (Scotland), 2011, Danger, Neglect and Human Wrongs?

63,SH - Sahir House,"                       Points to raise in the Universal Periodic Review on Human Rights  Introduction  Sahir House has a decade of experience in dealing with asylum seekers and refugees and the and this report contains issues we are continuously faced with and have to challenge on a daily basis.  Asylum seekers who are HIV positive are faced with multiple oppressions and are bereft of any economic, social or political power.  Therefore, we are advocating on behalf of this much marginalised group.  In this submission Sahir house seek to assist the UN in assessing the United  the Universal Periodic Review. We have chosen to focus on four issues which we consistently feel are at risk of breaching the human rights of asylum seekers whom we work with. We feel that performance.   Issue  - Proposed cuts to Legal Aid These cuts are being met with strong opposition. We agree with Supreme Court Judgseekers.  The cuts will  These cuts place the most vulnerable people at risk and only target the poorest in our society. Asylum seekers are not allowed to work, and therefore have no means of earning the money to access legal services.  This increases the risk of asylum seekers engaging in criminal activity, or being exploited by sexual predators in order to obtain money for legal services. This will cause a direct increase in the costs required for police services, courts, prison costs etc.  Asylum seekers will increasingly face unlawful removals, unlawful detention and the forced break-up of their families, and the risk if being tortured or killed upon return to their countries (The Guardian, 2011). This is because these cuts make the UKBA less accountable by law.   Recommendations Allow Legal Aid support to continue. This is particularly important for asylum seekers, as there is evidence which demonstrates that the UKBA have a history of  making wrong decision on applications in their initial stages.  The Home Office statistics in 2009 showed that 87% of cases were refused initially and 42% of initial decisions were over turned on appeal.  This rose to 50% when reconsiderations were taken into account. The number of appeals allowed by the judges reflected the lack of knowledge and understanding case owners had of country of origin information (COI) and relevant case laws. Administration and bureaucracy must be cut before front-line services are.  The Government could continue to provide Legal Aid by abolishing unnecessary enforcement measures. In 2010, the average daily overall cost of one bed per day in the immigration detention estate was £120.  The Secretary of State Ken Clarke announced on the 29th June 201 that a possible 20 million pounds would be given for non-profit advice after criticising the proposed cuts to legal aid (Bowcott, 2011b).   Issue  The Detention of children  In July of last year, the Government promised to end child detention by May 2011. When comparing the number of children detained in May to the children detained in September 2011, it is apparent that there has been a 50% increase (Home Office, 2011a). Even more alarming is the fact that 50% of children detained in September were under 5 years of age (Home Office 2011a). These numbers have Children's Society (2011). The Independent Monitoring Board recently described some detention facilities at Heathrow as ""degrading"" (Johnson, 2011) and not suitable for children.  In addition to this, we are concerned that Barnados were contracted by the Home Office as a service provider at the new families detention centre at Pease Pottage in Sussex (NCADC, 2011). Whilst their Chief Executive has attempted to defend this centre, we feel that this appears to condone child detention. In addition to this, the new so--children This is because families with children will still  be taken to the facility against their will, and will be forced to remain in a secure unit surrounded with electronic fencing, and 24-hour staffing.  The case of R (on the application of Suppiah) v Secretary of State for the Home Department demonstrated that, despite overwhelming evidence that detention is harmful to children, UKBA officials ignored even their own guidelines on detaining only as a last resort. Alternatives were not pursued, UKBA claims of offering assisted voluntary removal prior to detention were untrue, and excessively long periods of detention were being used needlessly.    Recommendations - Stop child detention We recommend that the Home Office should launch an enquiry in to why excessive numbers of children continue to be detained, despite the Governments admission that this is a serious breach of their Human Rights under the ECHR. First and foremost, it is not clear that the evidence on alternatives to detention has been properly understood. There is a very substantial body of research from Canada, Australia, US, UK and other countries in Europe which shows very clearly that the reasons why children are detained often have more to do with failings in the asylum process than with the unwillingness of families to co-operate.  The UK should adopt an international framework dealing with child detention similar to that of The Swedish Detention Model.    Issue  The Destitution Policy The UK uses destitution as a means of forcibly removing asylum seekers who have come to the end of their asylum process and returned to their country of origin.  This is a bureaucratic system put into place by the government in order to  from vanishing from an asylum process which has been declared by its own government   The Asylum Support Appeals Project shows that 70% of individuals, who are destitute, are a result of      Recommendations  Stop Destitution   The UK should explore other international models presently used for dealing with destitution i.e.  which involves exploring all possible immigration outcomes and provides asylum seekers with mechanisms to cope with negative decisions. Whilst these services can prove costly, Swedish authorities recognise that costs are balanced because of the limited use of detention. These models demonstrate the fact that there are other options available. The UK should also explore and adapt other international models when fundamental Human Rights i.e. .  Immigration Removal Centres should also encourage involvement and partnership work with other sector organizations such as Red Cross in order to promote a person centred approach.    Issue  The right to work for asylum seekers  The current UK policy on the right to work for asylum seekers is non-existent.  Asylum seekers currently have to rely on minimum support which falls below the poverty line and this includes families.  The cost of holding 800 people in detention centres is around 48 million a year about 12 time what it would cost to pay them income support and housing benefit (Hayter, 2004).  If asylum seekers were given the right to work, these figures would be dramatically reduced as this would enable asylum seekers to contribute to the economy.   Although the UKBA may allow some individuals to work, this is restricted on the basis that you can yourself prove that it has taken the UKBA longer then 12 months to make a decision on your asylum application.  This is however at the discretion of the UKBA and as front line workers we are yet to witness case owners granting permission for asylum seekers to work. Recommendation  Allow asylum seekers to work  We recommend that the government grants permission to asylum seekers to work whilst their case is being decided.  This means that they would not be reliant on public funds and will be able to financially sustain themselves. This will directly reduce the cost of providing asylum support and encourage individual asylum seekers to integrate and engage with local communities, thus meeting the aims of the government to tackle social exclusion.  By granting permission to work the government would reduce the costs incurred by enforcement and criminal procedures, as asylum seekers would be less inclined to work illegally and be enticed by crime.  This would also increase the safeguarding of asylum seekers who are at high risk of exploitation from employers due to their extreme poverty and vulnerability (not allow history to repeat itself i.e. cockle pickers).

64,SHSH - Still Human Still Here," 1   1. Introduction  1.1 Still Human, Still Here is a coalition of more than 50 organisations which are campaigning to end the destitution of refused asylum seekers in the UK. The coalition includes all the main agencies working with refugees in the UK along with other organizations which are increasingly having to assist asylum seekers because of problems linked to destitution, such as Citizens Advice Bureau, OXFAM and National Aids Trust.1   1.2 Article 11 of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which the UK has ratified, Still Human Still Here believes that the level of support available to asylum seekers who are waiting for decisions on their applications is now so low that many are unable to meet their essential living needs of adequate food, clothes and toiletries. Still Human is also concerned about those asylum seekers who have had their application refused and are then left destitute in the UK without any form of statutory support at all.   2. Inadequate support for asylum seekers awaiting outcomes on their applications  2.1 Under Section 95 of the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act, asylum seekers receive a living allowance and a no-choice offer of accommodation outside London, or an stay with family or friends.   2.2 During the passage of the 1999 Bill, the Government set support rates for asylum seekers at 70 per cent of Income Support and noted that 2 Ten years later, the rationale for reduced payments of 70 per cent remained essentially unchanged, with the Home Office stating:   levels of subsistence support reflect the temporary nature of support to an asylum seeker and the fact they have access to fully furnished, rent free accommodation 3                                                  1 See http://stillhumanstillhere.wordpress.com/for a full list of members and further details. 2 Immigration and Asylum Bill on 11 May 1999.  Income Support is generally considered to be the minimum amount required to meet essential living needs (not including accommodation).  3 Home Office response to a letter from the Red Cross to the Home Secretary on changes to support rates, 23 September, 2009.   2 2.3 However, by 2011, Section 95 support levels had been reduced well below 70% of Income Support for the majority of asylum seekers making it extremely difficult for them to meet their essential living needs while they are awaiting the resolution of their cases. Asylum seeking couples, lone parents and single adults under 25 years old receive an average of 67% of Income Support, while single adult asylum seekers over 25 get just 54%. The vast majority of asylum seekers now have to survive on just over £5 a day (all single adults receive £36.62 a week).  Asylum seekers are not allowed to work to support themselves unless they have been waiting for more than one year for a decision to be made on their initial application.  2.4 Section 95 of the 1999 Act defines a person as destitute if they are homeless and/or cannot Still Human Still Here does not believe the current levels of support are sufficient to meet essential living needs of food, clothes and toiletries and to pursue an asylum application.  2.5 Still Human calculated the cost of meeting those needs by adapting the basket of basic goods compiled by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 2008 as part of their research for minimum income standards in Britain. Items that would not generally be considered essential to avoid absolute poverty were removed.4 Accordingly, Still Human estimates that an asylum seeker in 2008 would have needed a minimum of £31.66 a week for food5 and a further £9.70 a week to meet the costs of household cleaning items, toiletries, cold/flu remedies, paracetamol, telephone calls, stamps, clothes and travel. Taking inflation into account, the minimum required for a single adult asylum seeker to meet their essential living needs in 2009 amounted to no less than £43.60 a week. Allowing for inflation for 2010 this means the cost of meeting essential living needs for 2011-12 would be approximately £45 a week.  2.6 In 2011, a single adult over 25 years old received £67.50 on Income Support. If an asylum seeker was given 70 per cent of this amount they would receive £47.25  roughly equivalent to the minimum estimate for essential living needs calculated above.   3. The support system for refused asylum seekers  3.1 If a person is refused asylum and has no further opportunities to appeal, they lose their right to accommodation and support 21 days later. The main exceptions to this are refused asylum seeking families with children who should continue to receive support under Section 95, and refused asylum seekers who are destitute and qualify for support under Section 4 of the 1999 Act by showing that they are taking steps to leave the UK or are unable to do so through no fault of their own (e.g. they are too sick to travel, there is no viable return route to their country, they have a judicial review pending).                                                   4 The Joseph Rowntree Foundation research on minimum income standards looked at needs, not wants.  For more information see: www.minimumincomestandard.org    5 Food includes 56 items which would provide a balance diet. Alcohol and other clearly non-essential items of expenditure have been removed.    3 3.2 Those who are granted Section 4 support will receive £1.23 less than they would have got on Section 95 support. It is also delivered through a plastic payment card rather than in cash and can only be spent in certain shops.  This makes it even more difficult for asylum seekers as they have no cash for phone calls or transport and cannot get best value by shopping in markets and discount stores. At the end of June 2011, just under 2,500 people were on this form of support.  3.3 In 2010, it was estimated that around 70% of destitute asylum seekers in the UK came from just eight countries, all of which were either in conflict or had serious and widespread human rights violations (Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Eritrea).6   4. The consequences of destitution   4.1 As a result of the policies outlined above, thousands of asylum seekers are living in destitution with either inadequate support or no support at all, and with no opportunity to work to support themselves.   4.2 Between 2008-2010, the British Red Cross alone has provided assistance to approximately 10,000 destitute asylum seekers each year. A survey of Red Cross clients in 2010 found that 28% slept rough at some stage and nearly 90% survived on one meal a day.7  4.3 incidence of mental and physical health problems amongst asylum seekers in recent years. The Royal College of Psychiatrists noted in 2007 that: health of refugees and asylum seekers currently worsens on contact with the UK asylum available at all times throughout the asylum process, including (for) those whose claims 8  4.4 A recent report by the Institute of Race Relations, found that twenty eight asylum seekers took their own lives after their asylum claims were turned down during a five year period and attributed some of the deaths to the fact that the asylum seekers were destitute and unable to access social services. The cases documented included:   Serguei Serykh, his wife Tatiana and their 19 year old son, Stepan, who were refused asylum in the UK and committed suicide from the balcony of their 15th floor flat in Glasgow on 7 March 2010. This was the date their support vouchers were due to be stopped.                                                   6 Still Human Still Here, At the end of the line, 2010, page 38. 7 British Red Cross, Not gone, but forgotten, June 2010, pages 21-22. 8 The Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP), Improving services for refugees and asylum seekers: position statement, Summer 2007.   4  Osman Rasul Mohammed, an Iraqi asylum seeker who jumped from a tower block in Nottingham on 25 July 2010. He had been in the UK since 2001, was destitute and was having problems accessing legal advice.9  5. Recommendations  5.1 In May 2009, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights reviewed the UK and and difficult access to health care for rejected asylum-. It recommended that the UK ensure that asylum-seekers are not restricted in their access to the labour market while their claims for asylum are  -.  In 2010, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants endorsed these recommendations and urged the UK Government to -seekers   5.2 Still Human Still Here fully supports these recommendations and specifically urges the UK Government to:    Provide asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute with cash support equivalent of no less than 70% of Income Support until they have been given some form of status in the UK or been returned to their country of origin.   End Section 4 support and provide all those eligible with continued cash support through Section 95.   Grant asylum seekers permission to work if their cases have not been resolved in 6 months or they have been refused but cannot be removed through no fault of their own.   Provide free access to healthcare for all asylum seekers while they are in the UK          For further information contact Mike Kaye, Advocacy Manager for Still Human Still Here on 020 7033 1600 or mike.kaye@amnesty.org.uk                                                   9 The Institute of Race Relations, Driven to Desperate Measures: 2006-10, October 2010. Cases in the report are indicative and likely to severely underestimate the total number of deaths in the period reviewed.

Company limited by guarantee: SC220213.  Univeral Periodic Review - Session 13  An NGO submission on transgender and intersex human rights situation in the UK     Submitted by:  James Morton, Scottish Transgender Alliance Project Coordinator, Equality Network on 21 November 2011     Part A - Summary:     1. The Scottish Transgender Alliance (STA) is the only transgender equality and human rights policy and legislation project currently receiving any funding in Scotland. The Scottish Transgender Alliance is a project within the National LGBT NGO, Equality Network, which is a registered Scottish charity, SC037852. The Equality Network office is 30 Bernard Street, Edinburgh, EH6 6PR, Scotland, UK. The Equality Network's Scottish Transgender Alliance website is www.scottishtrans.org     2. We particularly welcome as good practice: 2.1 That the UK now recognises sexual orientation and gender identity persecution as grounds for seeking asylum in the UK;  2.2 That the Scottish Government is currently carrying out a consultation process with a view to the potential implementation of legislation to allow same-sex marriage and to remove the requirement for transgender people to divorce in order to receive legal gender recognition and that the UK Government is anticipated to begin a similar consultation shortly;  2.3 That the UK and Scottish Governments are both active in consulting transgender people in the development of action plans for improving gender identity equality and human rights.   3. Our recommendations for the UK are:  3.1 To implement transgender awareness training for UK Border Agency staff, especially those working in asylum detention centres;  3.2 To end the use of the ""fast-track"" asylum process for transgender asylum seekers;  3.3 To create new healthcare protocols for intersex people, with the active involvement of intersex human rights organisations such as Organisation Intersex International (OII) www.intersexualite.org, which fully respect the rights of children and young people in regard to bodily autonomy and consent to medical procedures;  3.4 To remove the Gender Recognition Act 2004 requirement to end an existing marriage or civil partnership before receiving a full gender recognition certificate;  3.5 To amend the Gender Recognition Act 2004 to ensure that all intersex people who wish to correct the gender recorded on their birth certificate can do so;  3.6 To provide the option of ""X - unspecified gender"" on all identity documents, especially passports, for those transgender and intersex people who do not identify as male or female.

Company limited by guarantee: SC220213. Part B - Details:      Asylum:     4. The Equality Network's Scottish Transgender Alliance strongly welcomes that the UK government now recognises sexual orientation and gender identity as grounds for seeking asylum in the UK.     5. However, our involvement researching and writing the LGBT asylum research report Sanctuary, Safety and Solidarity published March 2011 (http://www.scottishtrans.org/Article.aspx?id=68) has highlighted that the procedural realities of the UK asylum process do not yet fully uphold the human rights of LGBT asylum seekers, especially for transgender asylum seekers who remain at particular risk of transphobic physical and sexual assault and degrading treatment (such as refusal to recognise their gender identity, current name and pronouns) when held within UK asylum detention centres.     6. We recommend that the UK should implement transgender awareness training of UK Border Agency staff, especially those working in detention centres, to improve their ability to uphold the human rights of transgender asylum seekers.     7. We recommend that, given the particular vulnerability of transgender asylum seekers within detention centres and the complexity of identity documentation issues and terminology translation, the UK end the use of the ""fast-track"" asylum process for transgender asylum seekers.      Intersex Healthcare:     8. Leading intersex human rights organisation, Organisation Intersex International (OII) www.intersexualite.org, ""campaigns against all non-consensual normalisation treatments of infants that are not medically necessary and favour the right of all intersexed children to determine their own sex identity once they are capable of communicating it... Once the child has communicated clearly their own sex identity, it is crucial that the child's identity be respected both by the parents, physicians and therapists who are caring for the child.  All steps should be taken to respect the child's own sense of self by being given access to all health care necessary to facilitate life in the sex the child considers most appropriate."" (http://www.intersexualite.org/English-Offical-Position.html)  At present in the UK there are no national human rights affirming intersex healthcare protocols so intersex people cannot yet be confident that their human rights will be adequately upheld by medical professionals.     9. In solidarity with Organisation Intersex International (OII) we recommend the the UK create new healthcare protocols for intersex people, with the active involvement of intersex human rights organisations such as Organisation Intersex International (OII) www.intersexualite.org, which fully respect the rights of children and young people in regard to bodily autonomy and consent to medical procedures.       The Scottish Transgender Alliance is a project within the National LGBT NGO, Equality Network   +44 (0) 131 467 6039 www.equality-network.org & www.scottishtrans.org Registered Scottish charity: SC037852. Company limited by guarantee: SC220213.  Gender Recognition:     10. We strongly welcome that the Scottish Government is currently carrying out a consultation process with a view to the potential implementation of legislation to allow same-sex marriage and to remove the requirement for transgender people to end an existing marriage in order to receive legal gender recognition and that the UK Government is anticipated to begin a similar consultation shortly. The current UK requirement to end an existing marriage or civil partnership in order to receive legal gender recognition causes intense distress to transgender people, their spouse/partner and their children as it forces the sacrifice of the human right to marriage and respect for family life in order to access the human right to privacy and access legal gender recognition.     11. The Human Rights and Gender Identity Issue Paper by Thomas Hammarberg, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights recommends that Council of Europe member states ""remove any restrictions on the right of transgender persons to remain in an existing marriage following a recognised change of gender."" (https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1476365)     12. We recommend that the UK remove the Gender Recognition Act 2004 requirement to end an existing marriage or civil partnership before receiving a full gender recognition certificate.     13. The requirement within the Gender Recognition Act 2004 to have a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria / gender identity disorder / transsexualism prevents intersex people from accessing legal gender recognition because these medical diagnoses are not permitted to be diagnosed in people who have already been medically diagnosed as having a physical intersex condition.     14. We recommend that the UK amend the Gender Recognition Act 2004 to ensure that all intersex people who wish to correct the gender recorded on their birth certificate can do so.     15. Some intersex and transgender people do not have a binary gender identity of male or female. At present they are unable to access any identification documents in the UK which recognise that they do not have a male or female gender identity. If they wish to apply for identification documents such as a passport, they are currently forced to deny their personal identity and forced to use the legal gender recorded on their birth certificate. The lack of access to recognition of their non-binary identity is especially problematic in regard to passports as this prevents them from having freedom of movement. Other countries in the world, such as Austrailia, are now starting to implement non-binary identity options for those intersex and transgender people who do not identify as male or female.     16. We recommend that the UK provide the option of ""X - unspecified gender"" on all identity documents, especially passports, for those transgender and intersex people who do not identify as male or female.      Community consultation by Governments:     17. We strongly welcome as good practice that the UK and Scottish Governments are both active in consulting transgender people in the development of action plans for improving  The Scottish Transgender Alliance is a project within the National LGBT NGO, Equality Network   +44 (0) 131 467 6039 www.equality-network.org & www.scottishtrans.org Registered Scottish charity: SC037852.

66,SY - Sex YOUality," 1 UPR Submission: United Kingdom November 2011  Information submitted by:  SexYOUality, Registered Charity Nr. 1097096.1 International Human Rights Obligations and Commitments 1.  We note that the United Kingdom has ratified:  The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), including Article 2 on non-discrimination and Articles 28 and 29 on the right to education  The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), including Article 2 on non-discrimination and Article 13 on the right to education 2.  We note that the United Kingdom has supported:   3. We further note that the United Kingdom has welcomed:2  The Yogyakarta Principles, on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity, which include Principle 2 on the right to equality and non-discrimination and Principle 16 on the right to education Homophobic and Transphobic Bullying in Schools 4.  Young lesbian, gay and bisexual people still face widespread discrimination, exclusion and verbal and physical violence within schools because of their sexual orientation. Almost two thirds (65%) of young lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) have experienced bullying, and almost all (97%) hear insulting homophobic remarks and language in their schools. 70% of bullied LGB pupils report that this has a negative impact on their school work, and 50% have skipped school because of it.3 5.  Teachers are not given adequate training to be able to prevent and respond to homophobic bullying. 90% of teachers and staff in secondary and primary schools have never received such training. Schools also fail to communicate clearly that homophobic bullying is wrong: only 23% of LGB pupils state that their schools have done so. As a result, over 50% of LGB pupils never report bullying. The pupils who do report homophobic bullying say that when they tell a teacher, more than 60% of the time nothing is done in response.4 6.  Local and school-specific data on incidents of bullying are needed for schools and local authorities to tackle bullying effectively and to track progress in the prevention of bullying. Currently, there is no obligation for such data to be collected in the UK. However, some local                                                  1 Correspondence regarding this submission is to be addressed to Lara Jaffey, SexYOUality, Office A, Dales Brewery, Gwydir Street, Cambridge, CB1 2LJ, lara@syacambs.org, 01223 369508. 2 Foreign & Commonwealth Office (2008).

Retrieved from www.stonewall.org.uk/education_for_all/research/2731.asp; and from: Stonewall www.stonewall.org.uk/education_for_all/research/1790.asp.   2 authorities are taking voluntary steps. In 2010, the Health Related Behaviour Survey (HRBS) was adapted in Cambridgeshire to include, for the first time, questions on homophobic bullying.5 The survey, answered by all 4711 pupils aged 14-15 years in the county, found that:  LGB pupils are more than three times more likely than their straight peers to be subjected to a wide range of verbal and physical aggression, including having: received nasty or threatening phone calls, text messages and emails; been threatened for no reason; been threatened with a weapon; and been ganged up on. They are also more likely to: be teased or made fun of; be called nasty names; be ignored or left out; be pushed or hit for no reason; be asked for money; and have their belongings taken or broken.  18% of LGB pupils are very often or often afraid of going to school because of bullying (compared to 4% of straight pupils) and an additional 25% are sometimes afraid of going to school (compared to 13% of straight pupils).  40-50% of LGB pupils report that schools do not tackle bullying at all or do not tackle bullying in a helpful manner, e.g. by having clear rules about bullying and always responding when bullying happens. Less than 30% find that schools take such steps against bullying in a way that is helpful. 7.  There is insufficient data and research documenting the prevalence, forms and consequences of transphobic bullying in schools in the UK. Further research and data is urgently needed, as existing surveys show that young trans people face widespread discrimination, exclusion and verbal and physical violence within schools because of their gender identity or expression: Some 64% of young trans men and 44% of young trans women will experience harassment or bullying at school, not just from their fellow pupils but also from school staff including teachers. These are higher rates than shown in many studies on young lesbians and gay men at school. [...] [R]esearch also counters the commonly held belief thathat females who become trans men later in life faced the most harassment and bullying [...]. (p. 16)6  The problems regarding the lack of teacher training and unavailability of local data (paragraphs 5 and 6) are even more pressing in the context of transphobic, rather than homophobic, bullying. Recommendations 8.  In order for the UK to fulfill its human rights obligations under the CRC (art. 2, 28, 29) and the ICESCR (art. 2, 13), including to direct education to the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity, without discrimination of any kind, we recommend: i. That all primary and secondary schools record, monitor and publish data on homophobic and transphobic bullying and incidents.  ii. That all teachers be provided with training on how to respond to homophobic and transphobic bullying during initial teacher training (ITT) and that Qualified Teacher Standards include explicit reference to homophobic and transphobic bullying. iii. That local authorities regularly conduct surveys on the health and well-being of pupils in primary and secondary schools, such as the Health Related Behaviour Survey (HRBS), that include issues related to sexual orientation, gender identity and bullying. iv. That the government commission research on the experiences of trans identified children and adolescents during primary and secondary education and on how schools best address their specific needs for protection from transphobic bullying.                                                  5 Baldwin Health Related Behaviour Survey (HRBS) 2010, Cambridgeshire. 6 Whittle, S., Turner, L., & Al-of Inequality and Discrimination.

67,UKJCW - UK Joint Commiton Women," 1   UK Joint Committee on Women  The UK Joint Committee on Women (UKJCW) is made up of representatives from UKJCW was set up about 20 years ago to co-ordinate a UK view with respect to the European Women's Lobby and to provide forums for discussion and information to women and women's organisations. UKJCW holds the single UK seat on the EWL board rotating it between the member organisations to ensure that all 4 nations have representation at the European level.  The umbrella organisations are: Engender - Scotland  NAWO - National Alliance of Women's Organisations - England NIWEP - Northern Ireland Women's European Platform  WEN Wales   (interim) UKJCW welcomes the opportunity to participate in the Universal Periodical Review process. We believe it is critical s is integrated into the process to ensure that the human rights perspective is inclusive of a gender perspective. Integrating a gender perspective fully into the  examination, gives a full perspective of the situation of human rights in the UK.  UKJCW is built on a 4-nation model and has a unique perspective of human rights within the context of devolution in the UK.  Our model of working enables us to have an understanding of the human rights situation for women on the ground across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Although it is clear that devolution settlements, the Human Rights Act, and the European Convention on Human Rights are interwoven elements of the UK's constitutional framework, a gendered analysis reveals that human rights in reality differ for women across   2  the 4 nations. Historically, discussions at international level have failed consistently to reflect these differences and instead have demonstrated a London-centric perspective, influenced perhaps by UK government analysis.  Two examples of difference across the 4 nations are explored belowaccess to reproductive health services and support for women who have experienced violence against women.  It is critical that the UPR takes into account the reality of human rights for women on the ground across all the UK. Current debate in the UK regarding human rights is centered on the function of the Human Rights Act. The UK government has established a commission to explore the case for a UK Bill of Rights; this could lead to major amendments or a repealing of the Human Rights Act in favour of a new bill of rights. UKJCW has concerns that this may lead to the limiting of human rights especially for women if this debate continues to evidence the lack of an integrated gender perspective. Human right norms and standards need to be analysed from a gender perspective human rights. Efforts at ensuring that human rights legislation and implementation integrate gender considerations are essential in achieving implementation of human rights standards and norms that is sensitive to the needs and experiences of women. We have chosen to focus this brief report on three priority areas:  the impact of UK government responses to the global financial crisis on women, lack of reproductive health access in Northern Ireland, and violence against women across the 4 nations.  How the financial sector  The UK economy entered recession in 2009, following a global financial crisis. It emerged from recession in 2010, but growth since then has been weak. The most recent growth figures, for Q2 of 2011, record UK growth of 0.2%.  Part of the UK Government response to the recession has been to implement austerity measures, with a drastic contraction in spending across the public sector   3  and retrenchment on public sector pay and pensions1. This has disproportionately affected women. House of Commons Library analysis of the June 2010 emergency budget, found that of the £8bn net revenue to be raised by financial year 2014-15, nearly £6bn will be from women, in contrast with just over £2bn from men. Although Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland set their own budgets with regard to devolved policy areas, they are funded by transfers from the UK Government2.  Labour market  The labour market impacts of recession and recovery have been wide-ranging. After a first-round impact on male-dominated industries within the private sector, such as construction and manufacturing, there has been shedding of female-dominated service sector and public sector labour. Women continue to suffer disproportionately in the labour market: in the year to August 2011, there was a increase in the number of male JSA claimants. Concerningly, all indicators of long-term unemployment worsened in the month to August 2011, and youth unemployment has steadily risen to approximately 20%.   Real wages and household incomes are falling rapidly, with the bulk of spending cuts yet to be implemented, so it is highly likely that unemployment will continue to increase through 2011.  more likely to work in low-pay, low-value occupations, are more likely to work part-time, and are more likely to work in the public sector. The UK labour market is characterised by persistent occupational segregation, rooted in gendered                                                            1 Women are already significantly less likely to qualify for state pensions because of gendered patterns of labour market participation and unpaid workloads. Modelling by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests that the number of men eligible for state pensions is fully 50% higher than the number of women. IFS, Child and Working Age Poverty and Inequality in UK: 2010, IFS Commentary C121, Joseph Rowntree Foundation, London, Oct 2011. 2 The Barnett formula is a mechanism used by The Treasury in the United Kingdom to adjust the amounts of public expenditure allocated to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales automatically to reflect changes in spending levels allocated to public services in England, England and Wales or Great Britain, as appropriate.   4  patterns of skills ac  aptitudes, preferences, and capabilities.  Simple quantitative measures of unemployment do not adequately reflect ikely to register as unemployed and are weakly attached to the labour market. However, current evidence, -representation in UK public labour market participation will be severe and long-lasting.   Welfare Reform  The UK Government is proceeding with a welfare reform agenda that purports to t with the formal labour market and simplifying what The Welfare Reform Bill, currently at committee stage, will substantially reshape the benefits architecture of the UK. A detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, but the measures in the Bill have been criticised for, inter alia, strengthening work incentives for one working adult but creating a benefit withdrawal rate that will be faster for second earners, and reducing subsidies for childcare costs.   The Welfare Reform Bill provides for the introduction of a 'Universal Credit' to replace a range of existing means-tested benefits and tax credits for people of working age, starting from 2013.  Besides introducing Universal Credit and related measures, the Bill makes other significant changes to the benefits system in the following key areas:  introduces Personal Independence Payments to replace the current Disability Living Allowance  restricts Housing Benefit entitlement for social housing tenants whose accommodation is larger than they need  up-rates Local Housing Allowance rates by the Consumer Price Index amends the forthcoming statutory child maintenance scheme   5   limits the payment of contributory Employment and Support Allowance to a 12-month period  caps the total amount of benefit that can be claimed. In parallel, the Government is requiring single parents to return to the formal labour market earlier, and is reducing support for disabled people. Services that enable women to combine paid work and unpaid care are being reduced as part of downward pressure on public spending.  While parity arrangements are in place for social security across the four nations, no account is taken of the different legislative provisions or service provision such as in relation to childcare.   Rather than ameliorating the impacts of it is likely that current welfare reform proposals, if implemented, will incentivise women to leave the labour market, thus entrenching existing gendered patterns of care.  Services  It is impossible to provide, within the scope of this paper, a comprehensive survey of the impact of public sector cuts on women. To a limited degree, gendered impacts can be mitigated by devolved administrations prioritising areas of service delivery that are being affected in other parts of the UK. This has happened, for example, with violence against women services, which have had ring-fenced funding maintained at current levels in Scotland. This contrasts with the position in some English counties, which have removed all funding to rape crisis and domestic abuse refuge services.  Work has been carried out, in some local areas, to identify the impacts of the cuts on women. Coventry was the focus of an equalities and human rights assessment of spending cuts, which set out the profound and adverse impact of some £30m reductions in benefits, coupled with the withdrawal of £38m of services3, on access to education and training, housing, health and social services, and violence against women (VAW) services.                                                            3 Stephenson, M., and J. Harrison (2011) Unravelling Equality? A Human Rights and Equality Impact Assessment of the Public Spending Cuts on Women in Coventry University of Warwick: Coventry    6  Although public sector equality regulation is diverging within the four nations4, there is a broad requirement to consider the impact of policy development, including spending, on women and men. There is little evidence to suggest that this is going on in a robust and substantive way, or that the outcome of equality impact assessment (EQIA) processes is gender-sensitive policy.  economic, social, and cultural rights, associated with the recession and responses to it:   Inadequate gendering of recovery and stimulus investment, which has focused on male-dominated, private sector industries such as construction; an increase in the number of modern apprentices, which is a skills acquisition programme that entrenches gendered occupational segregation, and returns negligible, or non-existent, wage premia to those completing the female-dominated frameworks; and funding for start-ups that has not been programmed in such a way as to tackle barriers to   Downward pressure on public spending that is resulting in a reduction in the services available to women to address their specific needs. This includes violence against women services, which are experiencing direct funding cuts and withdrawals of indirect support5 across the UK. Capacity building work, which enables public and private sector employers and service providers to gender their employment and service delivery practice, is also threatened by reducing budgets.   egulatory. Despite the World Bank listing the UK as the fourth best country in which to do                                                            4 The Equality Act 2010 provided for a single public sector duty in England, Wales, and Scotland, which would require public authorities to proactively promote gender equality (along with eight other protected grounds), eliminate discrimination and harassment, and promote good relations. Regulation of the public sector is devolved to Wales and Scotland, and each nation has regulated, or will regulate, quite differently. Northern Ireland has a similar, but differently cast,duty, Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  5 An example of indirect support might include the reduced rent programmes that many local authorities offer to charitable NGOs, and which are being reduced or removed as a result of pressure on budgets.    7  equalities legislation and regulation to be a drag on growth. Amid a wider programme of reform of non-departmental public bodies (NDPDs), there has been a transfer of capacity, both in terms of human resources, and in terms of budget, from the independent Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to the Government Equalities Office, which is a part of the UK Home Office. The EHRC is an NHRI with A status6, and has statutory powers to regulate around equalities, and to investigate and report on inequalities.  Recommendation:  The UK government should, as required by its own laws, provide a robust and evidenced  impact assessment of tax and benefits policies and change policies and programmes where their net effect is to further disadvantage women.    Reproductive Rights in Northern Ireland The 1967 Abortion Act, on which other parts of the United Kingdom rely for law in relation to termination of pregnancy, was never extended to Northern Ireland.  This means that women in Northern Ireland are discriminated against in relation to a fundamental aspect of health care.  Abortion is legal in Northern Ireland, but only for an extremely restricted set of circumstances.  Women in Northern Ireland seeking an abortion who do not meet these highly restrictive criteria must make a difficult and costly journey to another jurisdiction in the UK in order to undergo the procedure.   Some 1,123 women travelled to England in 2009 to obtain abortions7.   Recorded statistics show that 55,829 women have travelled to                                                            6 The EHRC is one of three NHRIs with A status in the UK. The Scottish Human Rights Commission (which works around human rights as they relate to devolved matters), and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (which works around all human rights matters), operate in those nations respectively.  Northern Ireland also has a separate equalities commission, the Equality Commission Northern Ireland. The EHRC does not operate in Northern Ireland.  7 Department of Health. Statistical Bulletin: Abortion Statistics, England and Wales: 2009 (published May 2010).    8  England to access a safe and legal abortion since the 1967 Abortion Act made abortion legal in the rest of the UK.  The Family Planning Association (FPA) knows that this figure is an underestimate, as many women will give false addresses to private clinics in England for fear of detection, and the numbers of women who obtained abortions in other European countries is unrecorded. The FPA estimate that since the 1968, as many as 80,000 women have travelled to England and other European countries from Northern Ireland to access safe and legal abortion services. The requirement to travel creates substantial additional risk to the physical and mental health of the women affected, and the financial burden discriminates against women from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds, rural women, girls, and migrant women.  Women from Northern Ireland also have to pay for the procedure which is available free of charge within the state National Health Service to women elsewhere in the UK.  The additional financial and logistical difficulties of travelling mean that some women from Northern Ireland obtain abortions later in their pregnancy, at greater risk to their physical health and mental health. There are also cases in which the legal restrictions and financial burden force women to pursue illegal and unsafe abortions within Northern Ireland. Whether the abortion is procured within the jurisdiction or elsewhere, provision for abortion aftercare in Northern Ireland is ad hoc, inadequate, and unsatisfactory. In short, the current legal position in Northern Ireland criminalises and discriminates against women on the basis of where they live.  Women are not afforded the same reproductive rights and choice that are available in the rest of the UK.  Abortion law in Northern Ireland is still bound by the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which includes life imprisonment for any woman found to have terminated a pregnancy.  There is no provision in Northern Ireland for abortions to be legally carried out on grounds of rape, incest and foetal abnormality.   An abortion can only be carried out legally in Northern Ireland if continuance of the pregnancy constitutes a serious permanent or long term risk    9  The restrictive nature of the law in relation to abortion in Northern Ireland and the pecuniary disadvantage that women face in having to pay for an abortion privately in England and other European countries have more recently led to women illegally procuring medical abortions over the internet. Section 5 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 places a duty and legal obligation on as a discouragement for women who encounter medical complications from self-administered medical abortions from seeking medical assistance. These penal provisions contained within the legislation relate to a medical procedure and health risk only experienced by women. This continuing discrimination against women has been the subject of recommendations in a number of UN reports.  The CEDAW Committee in 1999, and again in 2008, in its concluding observations of the examination of the UK government, noted its concern that the government had not addressed this issue.  In 2008 it recommended that a process of public consultation should be initiated, that abortion law should be amended to remove punitive provisions imposed on women who undergo abortions, and that health services should be delivered in a gender-sensitive manner to all health concerns of women.8 These concerns have been further validated by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, who in their concluding observations on the UK and Northern Ireland in 2009, made the following recommendation regarding the provision of abortion services in Northern Ireland:             law of Northern Ireland to bring it in line with the 1967 Abortion Act with a view to preventing clandestine and unsafe abortions in cases of rape, incest or foetal abnormality9                                                            8 Concluding Observations of CEDAW regarding: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 18 July 2008, C/GBR/CO/6, at paras. 41 and 42.  9 Concluding Observations of CESCR regarding: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 22 May 2009, E/C.12/GBR/CO/5, at para 25.    10  been repeatedly raised by NGOs, and exhaustive attempts have been made to harm to women or to positively respond to concerns clearly establishes a pattern of failure on behalf of the UK government to adequately address the grave and government continues to bypass and ignore recommendations made by UN Committees and has made no effort to challenge the discriminatory social and Northern Ireland.  There is little optimism that the Northern Ireland Assembly will respond positively to secure reproductive rights for women in Northern Ireland.  In 2001, the Family Planning Association in Northern Ireland, concerned by inconsistencies in the interpretation of the law on abortion, sought a Judicial Review of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSS&guidance on when abortion is legal in the region.  In 2004, the Court of Appeal said that the DHSS&PS must issue guidance in relation to the termination of pregnancy in Northern Ireland and investigate the difficulties in obtaining services for the legal termination of pregnancy. The DHSS&PS issued guidelines early in 2007, allowing abortion when a woman's mental or physical health is in 'grave' danger of 'serious and permanent damage'. The Northern Ireland Assembly voted in autumn 2007 to reject these as being too immediate danger, was issued during the summer months of 2008 and, following attempts by the Assembly Health Committee to again amend them, were issued in March 2009 as guidance to all doctors and medical staff. The Guidance was explicit that abortion is not legal in the case of rape or foetal abnormality. However, that Guidance was withdrawn also, following a judicial review taken by the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child. The revised guidance was issued for consultation in July 2010, with a  final date for responses to the consultation of 22 Oct 2010. A year later, the Minister for Health replied to a written Assembly question on when the Guidance would be published with the   11  Pregnancy and as yet, no date has been set for its publicat-15).  The existence of devolution in the UK does not detract from the responsibilities of Westminster Government with regard to the implementation of the various human rights conventions, although Government attempts to argue (as it does in its most recent report to the CEDAW Committee) that responsibility rests with devolved governments.  Indeed the CEDAW Committee in its 2008 report noted its concern that devolution was resulting in the uneven application of the Conventions across the UK and was clear that overall responsibility rests with the State party.   The UK Government appears also to take a contradictory approach to the issue of reproductive rights in that, while Northern Irish women are at the peril of an outdated, arbitrary, and restrictive law on abortion and are  denied the same rights that are available to those throughout the rest of the UK, the Government  supports the extension of reproductive rights  internationally.  The Department for International Development (DFID) released a position paper in October 2009 on safe and unsafe abortion.10  In their policy paper it is stated that in countries where abortion is legal that they will support programmes that make safe abortion more accessible, and where abortion is not legal that DFID will make the consequences of unsafe abortion more widely understood.  It does not appear however that DFID follows their own policy in relation to their own country, in that women in Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, are still at risk of unsafe abortion. Recommendation:  The UK government should ensure that the legal regulation international human rights obligations; women in Northern Ireland should be able to secure early access to abortion services; there should be consultation on                                                            10 http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications/Safe-and-Unsafe-Abortion.pdf Accessed 18 January 2010.   12  this issue that is widespread and not confined to conservative or religious organisations.

A study in Wrexham, cited in a paper by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, 2007, found that 61% of married English Gypsy women and 81% of Irish Travellers had experienced domestic abuse, most of which was more severe and sustained violence than those within mainstream communities.11 It is rare for women to call the police for help for fear of rejection by the community, a situation not helped by the fact that there is only one, 10-room refuge dedicated to Traveller women in the UK, in London. Additionally, Traveller women and girls are:  Three times more likely to miscarry or have a still-birth  Have a significantly higher suicide rate and lower life expectancy with one third dying before the age of 59   Are taken out of education prior to secondary school to prevent them mixing with boys from other cultures, so illiteracy rates are high.  This is the back drop to the high-profile events at Dale Farm in which up to 86 Irish Traveller families were evicted with no culturally suitable alternative being 12 The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination condemned the eviction as disproportionate and expressed serious concerns that it may worsen the already high levels of discrimination and hostility towards Travellers and Gypsies.13 Of grave concern was the                                                            11 Julie Bindel The Guardian, Friday 25 February 2011 12 Amnesty International, http://action.amnesty.org.uk/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1194&ea.campaign.id=11724&gclid=COH6mKr7rqwCFYEZ4QodrCB0GQ 13 http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/statements/DaleFarm_Statement.pdf   13  Europe representative, Jan Jarab, to help broker a peaceful solution.14  It is important to note that whilst Dale Farm was a high profile eviction, only 19 days after the general election last year, £50 million that had been allocated to building new sites across London was scrapped from the budget, and the  only remaining traveller liaison worker in London is funded by the Irish government. 15  The burden of all of this is unduly born by the women in the community, who are left to organise the living arrangements, health, education, and other services for the family.   Recommendation:  The UK government should ensure that adequate provision of culturally appropriate sites and support services are granted to Travellers and Gypsies, to reinsert the duty on local councils to provide sites for Travellers and Gypsies, and for the UK government to ensure it complies with its international obligations.      Violence against Women Despite recommendations from CEDAW and ICESCR concluding observations over the last 4 years, the UK government has made little progress on creating or delivering a coordinated, 4-nation strategy on violence against women.  The UK y that covers England and departments whose business is reserved to the UK Parliament (not devolved to Northern Ireland, Scottish or Welsh governments), and this plan is meant to locate the issue within the international human rights framework.  A Gender Directors Network has been set up by the Government Equalities Office, but its members meet rarely, its objectives and outcomes are neither transparent nor                                                            14 http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/19/dale-farm-evictions-un-negotiation 15 Julie Bindel The Guardian, Friday 25 February 2011     14  published, and no negotiation of agreed outcomes around VAW (or gender, for that matter) is evident.  organisations providing frontline support to women survivors of violence, is precarious across England and Northern Ireland, with a series of ad hoc and insufficient arrangements raising doubts about the sustainability of the sector.  In Scotland, the new government has committed to level funding for both equalities work and for VAW services, and in Wales, the government has protected the violence against women budget within the then-Department for Social Justice and Local Government at a time of significant spending cuts. on implementation, and it is clear that sufficient funding is not being allocated to properly implement the plan.  VAW more than domestic violence? There is commitment to violence against women at policy level across 4 nations, but substantial and sustained support is missing for any form of violence other than domestic violence, and as mentioned above, that is endangered in the current public sector cuts.  Welfare reform contains significant retrenchment of housing benefit (a reserved matter), and local authorities will be faced with increasing numbers of women fleeing violence who no longer have access to housing benefit. There is little sign of more than marginal change of levels in support available for women in communities who are experiencing rape, prostitution, forced marriage, female genital mutilation or the other forms of VAW.  This is true in varying degrees across the 4 nations, for instance, rape and sexual assault services have received increased funding in England and Scotland, although existing supports are far from adequate. In Wales, there has been a huge amount of progress to tackle domestic abuse and other forms of violence against women over the past year:   15   Delivery of two innovative publicity campaigns aimed at challenging attitudes that normalise violence against women and allow it to continue unabated;  Expansion of the Wales Domestic Abuse Helpline (managed by Welsh   Publication of online guidance for teachers to deliver lessons on domestic abuse and other forms of violence against women in schools; In  Wales as elsewhere, national policy has not always translated into local delivery. Local authorities and other public sector institutions have no notion of -only VAW services and single-sex services due to the very protection they should be experiencing under the Equality Act 2010.    A critical component to improving women's human rights in relation to VAW across the 4 nations would be compulsory education from a human rights and gender equality perspective, from an early age, on healthy relationships, women's human rights and gender stereotypes. The government needs to ensure there is greater attention on the VAW prevention agenda to reduce the prevalence of VAW rather than just providing services after the incident.  And of course, real and unequal access to public participation and power in government and other seats of decision making. Recommendations:   1. The UK government, in collaboration with the devolved administrations, should coordinate a VAW strategy across the 4 nations that includes action plans across both devolved and reserved policy areas. 2. The governments of Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the UK government at Westminster should commit funds over a minimum of a 3-year period to support existing levels of specialist services for women and   16  children experiencing VAW and indicate how support will be increased to address service needs for FGM, victims of forced marriage, rape and sexual assault survivors, women, men and children involved in prostitution and other sex industry activity. 3. The UK government should ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Violence against Women, including Domestic Violence (CAHVIO).   Women with no recourse to public funds Women who are non-UK nationals have no recourse to public finds (NRPF) and are being denied access to even the minimal support that other women across the 4 nations can find.  These women are not eligible for benefits, such as housing benefit whilst in refuge, and are prohibited from employment.   Similarly, access to education and health and social care services is restricted.  The UK government recently established a fund that local agencies can apply to for token payments to support women; this fund has had little impact on women with no recourse or on   Recommendation: The UK government should change its current position on housing and benefits so that ALL women in the UK can access safe housing and support, education and health and social care services ,regardless of their immigration status.

Women in Prison, a national charity supporting over 4,000 women a year,2 believes that the United Kingdom (UK) is perpetuating gender inequality in the criminal justice system and rolling back progress in contravention of its national and international commitments.  The briefing outlines the commitments the UK has made, the lack of action taken and the impact of this inaction on women in the criminal justice system.    2. The United Kincovered by all of its international legal commitments.  This briefing will focus on the following international standards:   Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)  United Nations rules for the treatment of women prisoners and non-custodial measures for women offenders (Bangkok Rules)  United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners  European Prison Rules   Convention on the Rights of the Child  3. The UK has embarked on a process of criminal justice reform and Women in Prison recommend that this process should include the adoption of a national strategy for women in the criminal justice system designed to uphold their rights and dignity and eliminate gender-based discrimination in the criminal justice system.     The Need for a Gender-Responsive Criminal Justice System is Internationally and Nationally Recognised  4. The United Nations has recognised the need for gender-differentiated responses to offending.  The adoption of the Bangkok Rules demonstrates the international                                             1 Criminal justice is a devolved issue in the United Kingdom, the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly are responsible for criminal justice matters in their respective jurisdictions.   2 Founded in 1983 by a former prisoner, Women in Prison (a registered charity) works in England and aims to reduce the number of women in prison and prevent the damage done to women by imprisonment.  Women in Prison seeks to achieve this by providing information, advice and support services and campaigning for the rights of women in the criminal justice system.  Women in Prison supported 4,137 women in the last year.      2  understanding of and commitment to delivering a criminal justice system that upholds women's dignity and human rights by providing specific responses to their specific needs and circumstances.    5. -led, strategic, proportionate, holistic, woman-recommended in the government's 2007 report entitled A report by Baroness Jean Corston of a Review of Women with particular vulnerabilities in the criminal justice system (Corston Report).  The Corston report states:   risk of off  6. The UK's 2006 Equality Act created a proactive obligation on all state machinery to ensure gender equality.  Replaced by the 2010 Equality Act this duty remains and requires the government to take action to ensure that state policies and activities do not create or perpetuate gender-based inequality.    7. When the UK reported to CEDAW in 2008 the CEDAW Committee welcomed the measures taken by the United Kingdom in response to the Corston Report and made the following Concluding Observations:  The Committee urges the State party to intensify its efforts to reduce the number of women in conflict with the law, including through targeted prevention programmes aimed at addressing the caRecalling its previous recommendation, the Committee urges the State party to intensify its efforts to develop alternative sentencing and custodial strategies, including community interventions and services, for women convicted of minor offences. It also urges the State party to address the situation of women in prison through the development of comprehensive gender-sensitive policies, strategies and programmes. The Committee calls upon the State party to ensure that young female offenders are not held in adult prisons, to take further measures to increase and enhance educational, rehabilitative and resettlement programmes for women in prison and to ensure the provision of adequate health facilities and services, including mental health services, for women in prison. It also calls upon the State party to take further steps towards the establishment of small custodial units and community establishments, as well as 3    The Gap between Obligations and Commitments and Action  8. Women in Prison submits that despite national and international commitments the UK is taking no discernible action at this time to further the implementation of a gender-responsive criminal justice system and is in the process of rolling back some of the progress that has been made.  The UK has not fully implemented the recommendations made by the CEDAW Committee.  As a result women continue to face discrimination and inequality in the criminal justice system.     9. The UK government is undertaking a process of criminal justice reform in which women are invisible.  The principle piece of draft legislation arising from this reform process, the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill makes no mention of women                                             3  CEDAW/C/UK/CO/6 Extract from A/63/38, page 142, Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, para. 267  3  and no specific provision for women in conflict with the law. Since coming into office the current administration has stated that it is committed to the recommendations in the Corston Report.  However, no plan of action has been put in place and the visible leadership and transparency that existed under the previous administration has been removed.  This government has stated that it will not appoint a Ministerial Champion for Women in the Criminal Justice system and has not issued any progress updates on this agenda.4  Previously, the Ministerial Champion provided accountability for progress towards ending gender inequality in the criminal justice system and was instrumental in securing government funding for women-specific diversion schemes.  The cross-departmental unit that worked under her issued biannual progress reports on activities designed to implement Corston's recommendations, no such report have been issued since December 2009.    10. The UK says in its Seventh report to CEDAW that:   that women who offend are successfully rehabilitated, whether they serve sentences 5    The UK also states in this report that it is ing a strategy that will ensure that the women's sentence delivery, in both custodial and community environments, is fit for yet exist and no visible progress has been made towards it since the report was submitted to CEDAW in June 2011.      The Impact of Inaction on Women in the Criminal Justice System  11. The impact of the continuing gender-based discrimination and inequality in the criminal justice system is that the needs of women, as identified in the Corston report and which motivated the United Nations to develop and adopt the Bangkok Rules, are not being met. By way of example some specific impacts are:   Women are held in higher security conditions than required In contravention of international standards6 women are held in higher security conditions than required.  Whilst the men's prison estate is divided into four security categorisations (category A-D), there are only two security categorisations for women: Open and Closed.  There are 4,422 prison places for women in England and Wales, there are just two open prisons with a capacity of only 228 (5% of the overall capacity for women). Until March 2010 there was a third, mid-level, categorisation: Semi-Open.  This has been removed and the women previously categorised as suitable for semi-open conditions are now in closed conditions.  The lack of intermediate security categorisations makes it harder for women to progress through their sentence towards release.    The lack of accredited women-specific programmes in prison There is only one accredited women-specific behaviour programme available.  This is being delivered in one prison and currently has a cohort of 10 women.  The limited access to this programme and the lack of other women-specific programmes mean that women are not getting rehabilitative programmes that are needed to complete their                                             4 Record of Parliamentary Debate: Hansard, HC Deb, 2 November 2010, c737W  5 United Kingdom, Home Office: , para. 23  6 UN Standard Minimum Rules on the Treatment of Prisoners, Rule 63; European Prison Rules, Rule 18.10  4  sentence plans. This under-resourcing of rehabilitative programmes for women is resulting in women serving longer sentences than necessary as women are unable to fulfil parole board requirements to complete certain programmes due to a lack of provision not an unwillingness or inability on their part.     Disproportionately high rates of self-harm in women's prisons  Women are just 5% of the prison population but women account for 43% of all self harm incidents in prison.7   Inappropriate behaviour by male prison staff Following an unannounced inspection in 2010 the Chief Inspector of Prisons reported that in HMP Holloway:   women] reported unwanted attention from male staff, which they did not believe was appropriately dealt with and they had little confidence that anyone in authority would listen to them. They were disconcerted about male night staff observing them through hatches. Given the life experiences of many women prisoners, these reports were a particular concern. Some male staff were under investigation for alleged inappropriate behaviour, but senior managers said it was often very difficult to get conclusive evidence, even when they had identified concerns about specific individuals.8   Lack of appropriate clothing Women in Prison staff who regularly go into prison have reported that there is a lack of appropriate clothing, including a lack of underwear, in some prisons infringing their right to dignity.  Lack of effective, coherent response to prior experience of violence against women The UK has recognised that women who have experienced domestic violence or sexual abuse and women who have been involved in prostitution have particular support needs in prison and on release. A lead officer for both of these issues has been appointed in each women's prison.  However, there is no central guidance for these leads.  Previously there was just one domestic violence intervention run in prison, this was withdrawn when it was shown that the way in which it was run was increasing incidents of self harm amongst participants.  No programmes were introduced in its place.     Indefinite incarceration of women with mental illness UK law provides for a sentence of indefinite Imprisonment for Public Protection, the sentencing judge will give a minimum tariff which must be served in prison.  However, there is no maximum length to an IPP sentence.  In November 2010 there were 3,173 prisoners (men and women) on IPP sentences above their tariff.9  Almost 80% of women serving IPP sentences are convicted of arson which is an indicator of serious mental illness and self harm.10                                              7 Ministry of Justice (2010) Safety in Custody Statistics 2009 8 HM Chief Inspector of Prisons (2011) Report on a full unannounced inspection of HMP Holloway 15  23 April 2010, para. 2.35 Her Majesty's Inspector of Prisons is an independent inspection body which has a coordinating function for the UK's National Preventative Mechanisms under the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention Against Torture   9 Record of Parliamentary Debates, Hansard HC, 29 March 2011, c234W 10 HM Chief Inspector of Prisons and HM Chief Inspector of Probation (2008) The indeterminate sentence for public protection: A thematic review,  5  Failure to consider best interests of the child in sentencing their primary carers11 courts are failing to consider the best interests of the child when sentencing their primary carers.  An ongoing study has found that in all 42 cases examined no balancing exercise assessing the best interests of the child and public safety was undertaken, the rights of the child were not mentioned in a single case and in four examples no reference at all was made to the children.12     Proposed Recommendations  12. The women's prison population hit an 8-year low of in January 2011 (3,982).13  However, since then it has risen steadily (it was 4,208 on 18 November 2011).14  Women in Prison believes that in order to reverse this and to meet its international obligations towards women and in line with its national commitments the UK must:   Adopt a national action plan on women in the criminal justice system.  The action plan should include the following:  a) Women-specific commissioning and contracting  b) Women-specific drug rehabilitation services, in prison and in the community  c) A timetable for replacing the women's prison estate with a small number of small custodial units   d) Maintaining effective support for women in the criminal justice system which is independent of the system that punishes them  e) Creation of a central driver, supported by the MOJ Criminal Justice Women's Policy Team, responsible for ensuring delivery across government  f) A nationwide prison and community programme of prevention and support for women in the criminal justice system who have experienced domestic violence or sexual abuse  g) A specific action plan for women engaged in prostitution focussed on ending criminalisation and increasing exiting support  h) National provision of women-specific community sentences   i) Provision of specialist women-specific mental health liaison and diversion  j) Removal of systemic barriers to progression through custodial sentences towards release k) Ensure that the judiciary understand and act in line with their human rights obligations in regard to sentencing individuals with caring responsibilities for children                                               11 This is primarily a child rights issue, but is also equality issue as it disproportionately impacts on women in the criminal justice system as they tend to be the primary or sole carers of children.   12 Report of interim findings from a study conducted by Rona Epstein, University of Coventry.

69,WV - World Vision UK,"1 | Page     Child Protection and the United Kingdom Stakeholder Report on United Kingdom - Submission by World Vision UK For Universal Periodic Review, Second Cycle, Thirteenth Session, May - June 2012  1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. The context  1.1.1. The United Kingdom (UK) is a State Party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and its two Optional Protocols on the involvement of children in armed conflict  and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against Women; Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children to the Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime; and other international and regional agreements enshrining the right of children to protection from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect.  1.1.2. The UK and consists of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the latter three devolved national administrations, each with varying powers. Where there are differences, this report addresses progress and issues of concern only in relation to the non-devolved policies and practices. 1.1.3. The Government is to be commended for its efforts to reduce the exploitation and abuse of children in the UK and violence against them. However, greater steps are required to protect foreign national children from commercial exploitation and abuse both in the UK and overseas and to ensure that children are not involved in armed conflict.  1.1.4. The exploitation of children  in forced labour, sexual slavery, domestic servitude and as participants in armed conflict  is a growing crisis around the world. This problem touches the UK in many ways. Although accurate statistics are elusive, an estimated 1.2 children worldwide are trafficked each year for sexual, labour and other forms of exploitation. Official estimates for the number of children trafficked into England and Wales for commercial exploitation range from 300-400, although the Government acknowledges these figures are likely underestimated. Moreover, UK residents and citizens are contributing to the demand for exploited children overseas and the UK Government is not setting a strong global example in relation to children and armed conflict. 1.2. World Vision UK  a brief overview  1.2.1. World Vision UK is a Christian relief, development and advocacy organisation dedicated to working with children, families and communities to overcome poverty and injustice. As part of the international World Vision Partnership, which works in nearly 100 countries and serves more largest local charity, combining grassroots presence in thousands of communities with international reach across the globe.  1.2.2. as of focus for World Vision UK. We work with through our national offices and partners to strengthen the systems that are needed to protect children and to tackle underlying risk factors of violence,  2 | Page  exploitation and abuse through advocacy, community engagementresilience and long term development interventions.  2. PARTICULAR AREAS OF PROGRESS AND CONTINUING CONCERNS 2.1. Children and armed conflict 2.1.1. The UK Government maintains an interpretive declaration to the OPAC that the Protocol would not exclude the deployment under-18s into active conflict areas where: there is a genuine military need to deploy  and the nature and urgency of the situation make it impracticable to withdraw the child first or it would undermine the operational effectiveness of the unit or ship. By failing to remove this interpretive declaration, the UK Government maintains an irresolute position on the protection of children in armed conflict and is setting a poor example for other countries to follow. 2.1.2. Despite the commitment of the UK Government to take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forced who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities under the OPAC, five members of the UK armed forces under the age of 18 were deployed to operational theatres between April 2008 and March 2010. Additionally, from 1 March 2010 to 28 February 2011, 1,220 UK regular forces personnel under the age of 18 sustained some form of injury while training. While the UK Government recognises that minors in the armed forces are entitled to special protection, they have not reviewed the special provisions made for minors in the armed forces in recent years.  2.1.3. The Building Stability Overseas Strategy (BSOS) identifies foreign militaries to which the UK Government will provide International Defence Training. The Defence Assistance Fund, designed to bear the cost of military assistance and training activities under the UK Government policy of Defence Diplomacy, was operational in July 2011 and yet details of its activities remain conspicuously absent at a policy level. As a result, transparency is lacking in   2.1.4. Article 38 of the UNCRC requires Stake all feasible measures to ensure . In Section 8.5 of BSOSpolicies to prevent, manage and resolve conflict but does not address the special situation of children. The Government has committed to tackling violence against women and girls in the Call to End Violence Against Women and Girls; in the humanitarian policy Saving Lives, Preventing Suffering and Building Resilience; and in the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict strategy. These policies are to be commended for their focus on protection of civilians and commitment to tackling the vulnerability of girl children in conflict, post-conflict and other humanitarian emergencies. The strategy on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict does not make special reference to children. 2.1.5. Despite this focus, there remains a gap between UK commitment and implementation, where specific UK support to tackle violence against women and girls in humanitarian settings is evident as a commitment only, but lacking in clear policies for implementation. Where women and girls are identified as especially vulnerable, there is an absence of dialogue around children more generally.  2.2. Exploitation of children for commercial gain in the UK  2.2.1. Following its signature in 2000 and national review of compliance, the UK Government ratified the UNtution and child pornography (OPSC) in 2009. In the same year, the Government created a National Referral  3 | Page  Mechanism (NRM) for identifying victims of trafficking (in order to comply with its obligations under the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE Trafficking Convention)).  2.2.2. The national framework for safeguarding child trafficking victims, which recognises pieces of statutory and supplementary guidance on child trafficking issued by the Department for Education (DFE), the Home Office and the London Safe. Two and the London Child Protection Procedures. Both promote multi-agency working to identify and protect child victims, and provide clear guidance that all trafficked children should be  2.2.3. Identification of victims of trafficking, including child victims lies with the NRM. From 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011, a total of 390 children were referred to the NRM, including 134 for labour exploitation, 115 children for sexual exploitation and 52 for domestic servitude. However, only a positive conclusive decision that the child had been trafficked was only found in 141 cases. The lack of expertise in relation to children places serious doubts around the assessment procedures under the NRM. 2.2.4. The NRM sits under the Home Office and not the Department for Education, which has overall responsibility for safeguarding children. However, Chapter 41, Section 47 of the equires the local authority to investigate and take action if they have e cause to suspect that a child who lives, or is found, in their area is suffering, or is Despite this dual obligation to safeguard trafficked children, there is often poor understanding of trafficking indicators by statutory agencies and a lack of effective information sharing between agencies and other organisations, which results in non-identification of victims.  2.2.5. The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) also gathers data on suspected trafficking cases, relying on data from the police. CEOP has acknowledged the challenges of gathering accurate information.  While these numbers are generally acknowledged to be underestimates of the true number of trafficked children in the UK, they do provide a starting  2.2.6. A new national Human Trafficking Strategy, released in June 2011, contains a number of child-focused actions, including working with the criminal justice system to ensure that trafficked childrethose trafficked to work in cannabis factories in the UK, are still being prosecuted for their involvement in criminal activities. 2.2.7. The Government has also acknowledged that work must be done to better safeguard children who have been trafficked and that implementation of guidance for local authorities and child protection bodies , partially as a result of the common misperception that child trafficking is an immigration issue and not a child protection issue.  2.2.8. The UK Human Trafficking Strategy recognises issues with the safe accommodation of child victims of trafficking and the persistent problem of victims going missing from local authority care. There is a lack of understanding of how to safely accommodate children who may have been trafficked, insufficient funding and a lack of trained foster carers or small specialised residential centres for trafficked children. 2.2.9. Trafficked children also require a range of integrated support measures to create a protective environment around the child. These include interpreter services, legal advice and counselling. Article 10(4) of the CoE Trafficking Convention calls for provision of a guardian  4 | Page  for unaccompanied trafficked children to act in their best interests. The UK Government does not, however, feel that a legal guardian is required. 2.2.10. Provisions exist in the law to support child victims in the judicial process. However, in he insufficient support given to child victims and witnesses in court. 2.3. Exploitation and abuse of children overseas 2.3.1. The UK Government has an obligation to protect children from exploitation and abuse by British citizens and residents overseas. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 allows for prosecution of UK citizens and in some cases, residents, for sexual crimes against children committed in other countries. UK citizens can be prosecuted for any violation under the Act. However, unlike criminal acts committed in the UK, residents cannot be prosecuted under the extraterritoriality provision of the Sexual Offences Act unless the act was also a criminal act in the country where the offense occurred.  2.3.2. The Crown Prosecution Service has made progress bringing offenders to justice in the UK for these offences. However, successful prosecutions in the UK remain low and the UK Government has not been able to provide statistics on how many individuals have been prosecuted for extraterritorial crimes under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. 2.3.3. CEOP and UK police have worked with government and law enforcement agencies in certain countries to investigate cases of travelling sex offences against children and to increase the capacity of law enforcement to respond to such cases. CEOP has established Advisory Boards in Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines and has been working with law enforcement and child protection agencies to build their capacity. Ongoing collaborations in Cambodia aided conviction of Briton Michael Leach in Cambodia in September 2011 for sexual offences against three girls. This type of collaboration sets a good example of what can be achieved. However, it is still quite selective and tends to be reactive rather than proactive. The effectiveness of the capacity building has also not been measured.  2.3.4. The law also requires that all registered sex offenders in the UK notify the police of any intended travel outside the UK of more than 3 days. While the notification provision is a positive step, the information gathered must be shared with relevant officials in other countries to effectively prevent the abuse of children overseas.  2.3.5. In the Summer 2011, the Home Office undertook a public consultation on notification by sex offenders under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, including the possibility of requiring all sex offenders to notify of all foreign travel plans - closing the 3 day loophole that has continued to allow travelling sex offenders to abuse children, in growing travel destinations in Eastern Europe and North Africa. While the review of consultation responses has not yet been completed, it is expected that positive changes to the law will be made in 2012.   3. RECOMMENDATIONS  3.1 Recruitment of Under-18s:  3.1.1 The UK Government should set an example to other countries through their domestic policy on the recruitment and protection of children in the armed forces. The UK Government must withdraw its interpretive declaration to the OPAC and ensure that no one under 18 is deployed into conflict. The UK must ensure special provisions are made in the armed forces to provide the necessary protection needed for under 18s recruited into the armed forces. The UK Government must take a firm moral stand in its foreign policy that condemns the recruitment and use of child soldiers. UK policy towards humanitarian assistance, the stabilisation of  5 | Page  fragile states and the protection of civilians in conflict, must include specific mention of children affected by conflict and adequate provisions for the protection of child soldiers, whether considered combatants or after demobilisation. 3.2 Funding militaries that use child soldiers:  3.2.1 The UK Government must withdraw funding to all foreign militaries that recruit and use under-18s. Where military assistance is provided in the form of training, all measures must be taken to ensure no support is provided to the training of armed forces personnel under the age of 18. The UK must take a zero tolerance policy approach to supporting the role of children in armed conflict. Furthermore, that UK must publish details of the activities funded through the Defence Assistance Fund to ensure transparency in government funding.  3.3 Protecting children affected by armed conflict: 3.3.1 The commendable focus on tackling violence against women and girls must not be at the expense of a broader policy focus on the specific protection needs of children within and affected by armed conflict. UK Government policy on protecting civilians in conflicts and on building systems in fragile states must include specific mention of children and support the development of child friendly justice and protection mechanisms. 3.4 Protection of trafficked children into the UK:  3.4.1 The UK Government must review the current mechanism for identifying victims of trafficking, the NRM, in order to ensure that child victims are effectively identified and main role in identifying and investigating potential child trafficking cases. 3.4.2 Training on indicators of trafficking, identification and referral mechanisms, and the special vulnerability of child trafficking victims must be government mandated for all frontline agencies in contact with children who may have been trafficked, including local child safeguarding authorities and immigration authorities. 3.4.3 The UK Government must develop a system of guardianship for child victims of trafficking. The current system of support through the local authorities is inadequate to ensure that the best interests of the child victim are the primary consideration in all decisions regarding their care and protection. 3.4.4 The UK Government must ensure that child trafficking victims are not treated as criminals. They should not be prosecuted for any acts associated with their trafficking. 3.5 Protection of children overseas from abuse by UK citizens and residents:  3.5.1 The UK Government must create a safe, centralised system for monitoring foreign travel by registered sex offenders and those on the CEOP watchlist. This information should be shared with foreign authorities whenever reasonable and pertinent and used to identify potential travelling sex offender hot spots and to restrict travel of offenders if necessary.  3.5.2 The Sexual Offences Act must be amended to eliminate the double criminality requirement for prosecution of UK residents for sexual offences committed overseas. 3.5.3 In order to prevent UK offenders convicted overseas from being able to continue abusing children, the UK Government must take measures to facilitate the immediate deportation and return of the perpetrators to the UK upon their release. These measures should include bilateral agreements with recognised hot spots for travelling sex offenders. 3.5.4 The UK Government must continue the international cooperation and support provided to government and law enforcement agencies in countries where travelling sex offences are suspected to occur.

70,YWB - Yarl Wood Befrienders," , UK  Coordinator: Heather Jones Telephone: 01234 272090 Email: heather@ywbefrienders.org Website: www.ywbefrienders.org      Wood Immigration Removal Centre, aiming to affirm human dignity and restore self-esteem by listening and offering befriending a smaller unit for couples and familiWood since its opening in 2001.    Summary 1. Despite the fanfare surrounding the abolition of the indefinite detention of children in December 2010, the extensive use of administrative detention for adults remains a key part of UK immigration policy. The capacity of the detention increased to approximately 3,400 spaces.1  Wood Befrienders is particularly concerned at the effect of detention on vulnerable women and the inappropriate use of the Detained Fast Track to decide asylum cases. Our submission is based on with detainees. It argues that the human rights of women, citing specific groups of women in particular, are infringed by aspects of mmigration detention policy. Details of Our Concerns The Detained Fast Track ref. Articles 9, 10 and 11 (1) of the UDHR and Article 26 of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.  2. sometimes very different to those involved in applications by men. The UK Border Agency (UKBA)-Unsustainable (2011), with as many as 50% of initial decisions being overturned at appeal.2 The report found that, although gender-related persecution can engage the Refugee Convention on the grounds of membership of a particular sociSG entirely in the majority of cases based solely on gender-3  3. It would therefore appear vital that women are given sufficient time in which to prepare an asylum claim and early access to legal advice in case their application is wrongly refused and they need to go to appeal. However, many women are placed in the Detained Fast Track. The DFT process allows a detainee to meet their solicitor only the day before their asylum interview4, with a decision being made two days  many applicants are dropped by their solicitors at this stage. A report by Detention Action into the DFT cited Ministry                                                            1 Home Office Press Release, 6th July 2011. http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsarticles/2011/july/09larne-holding-centre, accessed 11/11/11 2 Asylum Aid, Unsustainable: the quality of initial decision-, Jan 2011, p.5  3 ibid. p.6 4 UKBA Detained Fast Track Operational Instructions, published April 2005, viewed on 10/11/11 at http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/asylumprocessguidance/detention/guidance/Detained_fast_track_process1.pdf?view=Binary  of Justice figures for January-September 2010 stating that 63% of DFT appellants were unrepresented at appeal.5   4. The fast- a grant rate of only 4% in 20086, compared with 31% for female applicants in the mainstream asylum system.7 The UKBA would argue that this proved that their screening system ensured only straightforward cases entered the DFT. However, Detention Action found that relevant information was not available 8 and The Joint Committee on Human Rights stated -seeker may be arbitrary because it is based on assumptions about the safety or otherwise of the country from which the asylum-seeker has come.9 Indeed, in 2008, 26% of cases entering the DFT were subsequently deemed unsuitable and removed from the process.10 It is not clear whether the cases were removed by UKBA case-owners themselves or after action by legal representatives. Legal representatives interviewed by Human Rights Watch for their report Fast Tracked Unfairness indicated it was generally the latter.11 Whatever the case, there is clearly a failing at the screening stage and vulnerable asylum seekers are being unnecessarily detained and having their recourse to due process infringed.   5. Flexibilities do exist in the DFT schedule, allowing for extra time to prepare the appeal, but often these provisions are refused, leading to a lack of evidence before the Immigration Judge: Case Study: A, Pakistan A, a Muslim, eloped to the UK with a Christian Pakistani who was coming to study in the UK. He became abusive and the marriage broke down. He withdrew his sponsorship, leaving her with no leave to remain in the UK. A claimed asylum because her father threatened to kill her if she returned. A was placed in the DFT and her solicitor requested more time in order to obtain an expert report. However, this request was turned down, Awas refused and her subsequent appeals were dismissed. A has since obtained fresh evidence which will be submitted as a fresh claim.                                                            5 Detention Action, Fast Track to Despair: The unnecessary detention of asylum seekers, May 2011, p.28 6 Human Rights Watch, Fast-Tracked Unfairness: Detention and Denial of Women Asylum Seekers in the UK, Feb 2010, p.29 7 ibid, p.15 8 Detention Action, Fast Track to Despair: The unnecessary detention of asylum seekers, May 2011, p.30 9  JCHR, The Treatment of Asylum Seekers, Tenth Report of Session 2006-07, Volume 1, p7 10 Human Rights Watch, Fast-Tracked Unfairness: Detention and Denial of Women Asylum Seekers in the UK, Feb 2010. p.30 11 ibid. p.30  6. The intensive, inquisitorial nature of the DFT is clearly not suitable for many vulnerable women, particularly those who have fled security forces in their home countries. However, some are still placed in it inappropriately: Case Study: B, country of origin withheld B received death threats from government security forces in her country of origin. She fled to the UK and claimed asylum. Despite a history of depression, her detention in the DFT was maintained. B was often deeply distressed when we visited her. Her claim was decided on the basis of a five-hour interview in which she said afterwards she could not think straight. She noted afterwards a number of discrepancies in her own account. Her solicitor dropped her case before her appeal and she was eventually returned to her country of origin. 7. DFT is used to process all types of claim: those who claim upon arrival, those who present themselves at the Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon and those who claim asylum only when encountered by police or immigration officers. The UKBA insist that an asylum seeker must make their claim at the earliest available opportunity, or their credibility will be damaged.12 Detaining those who actively request protection and disincentivises others from making claims. Case Study: C, Gambia C, who had fled gender-related persecution in her country of origin, went to the Asylum Screening Unit to claim asylum after being advised by a community organisation to consult a the DFT. Her solicitor was no longer able to act due to the distance. She expressed her confusion at having been C was refused asylum and failed at appeal, but a new solicitor took up her case and, due to a delay in removing C, was able to obtain the evidence necessary to lodge a fresh claim. Six months after being detained, C was released.    8. Aside from the issue of the DFT, many women we meet are, in our view, unsuitable for detention. structions and Guidance states that (amongst others) pregnant women (unless there is a clear prospect of early removal), victims of torture, victims of trafficking and those suffering from                                                            12 Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, Section 8.  13 outlined below.  9. Pregnant Women: In 2011, YWB has visited seven pregnant women. They were detained for an average of 88 days. Four of them were eventually released, one only after she suffered a miscarriage during the 20th week of her pregnancy. Minister of State for Immigration, Damian Green, admitted to the House of Commons that the number of pregnant women detained for immigration purposes is not currently monitored.14     10. Victims of Torture: In 2011, YWB has visited 14 women claiming to be victims of torture. Although the majority of these had visible scarring, they were deemed fit for detention as they had no independent evidence of torture. Being detained, they faced extreme difficulty accessing independent doctors to assess their scarring.  11. Victims of Trafficking: In 2011, YWB has visited 18 women raising issues of trafficking. This backs up findings by the Poppy Project, who have come into contact 15 since 1st April 2009, when the UK adopted the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.  12. Mentally ill detainees: Of a total of 248 detainees visited by YWB in 2011, 36 (15%) appeared to be suffering from mental health problems of greater significance than the level of anxiety routinely experienced by detainees. Several were subsequently released, but generally only as a result of legal challenges. failings in both the identification and care of those with mental health problems.   Long Term Detention, Especially of Mothers ref. Article 8 of the ECHR  13. Whilst we remain alarmed by the high level of long-term detainees, the statistics suggest that women do not tend to be detained for the extreme lengths of time men are. Still, government figures for the financial year 2010-2011 show that 106 women leaving the detention estate during this period had been detained for more than 6 months, 15 of these for between one and two years and five for more than two years.16                                                             13 UKBA Enforcement Instructions and Guidance, 55.10 14 Damian Green, Minister of State for Immigration, Home Office, Hansard 25 Oct 2011: Column 148W 15 London Evening Standard, Scandal of Trafficked Women held in UK, 21st Oct 2011 16 Damian Green, Minister of State for Immigration, Home Office, Hansard 25 Oct 2011: Column 148W  14. The policy of the UK government is not to separate children from their sole carer for the purposes of immigration detention. If a family unit includes both parents, one of these may be taken into detention, but a single parent will not be separated from his/her children at the time of detention. However, if the parent is imprisoned for a criminal offence, the children may be placed into the care of the social services or another family member at this point. If detention is maintained after the completion of the criminal sentence, the separation of parent and child for a specified time becomes an indefinite separation.   15. An inspection by the Independent Chief Inspector of the UKBA17 found that 97% of Foreign National Prisoners (FNPs) who the UKBA are seeking to deport are being transferred straight into immigration detention upon completion of their sentence. The Chief Inspector criticised this as being in contradiction with the published policy presuming release. He also noted a marked increase in the length of detention of FNPs, from an average of 143 days in February 2010 to an average of 190 days by January 2011.18  16.  six ex-Foreign National Prisoner women with children in the UK. All but one (83%) were detained for more than six months, with two (33%) detained for more than a year, of whom one (17%) was held for a period of more than two years. Of the six detainees, only two (33%) were removed from the UK, whilst four (67%) were released. The extended separation of a mother and child in particular sits uncomfortably with Article 25 of the EDHR, entitling motherhood and childhood to special care and assistance.  Case Study: D, Nigeria D, who had a baby daughter in the UK, was sentenced to a year in prison for an immigration offence, but was detained for a further two years D daughter came in to visit on several occasions, but the emotional wrench of separation was often too much for D and she could not cope with regular visits. The strain on the affective bond between mother and child was very apparent when they did meet. D mental health deteriorated significantly and she spent much of her time alone in her room. 17. Though the Prison Service funds many schemes enabling children to travel to visit their parents where financial barriers arise, no equivalent facility exists for children of parents held in IRCs. If children are in the care of the Social Services, experience that the local authority is reluctant to finance such visits.                                                             17 Independent Chief Inspector of the UK Border Agency, A thematic inspection of how the UK Border Agency manages foreign national prisoners, November 2011, 6.15 18 ibid. 6.6   18. Many of the women we visit who have been in prison say that the psychological burden of being in detention is even greater than that of prison because of its indefinite nature. With no fixed end-point, there is nothing concrete to focus on, leading to a feeling of despair. This is particularly difficult for mothers for whom every day spent in detention is another day apart from their child. The UK is one of the few European countries who impose no cap on the length of detention.   Detainee Property & Article 17 (2) of the UDHR  19. Though we do not gather statistics on the subject, many women we visit are awaiting removal to their country of origin without money or any of their clothes or belongings. This generally occurs in the instance of women who have been encountered during enforcement operations or taken into detention straight from a reporting centre. Flights can be arranged within three days and, even if a detainee has friends or relatives in the country, they are often unable to bring their belongings to the detention centre in time.   20. Although this is an issue for both men and women, women travelling alone in many countries are particularly conspicuous. Women without appropriate clothing and travelling without luggage are even more likely to stand out upon return, increasing their vulnerability. Returnees often fly into airports far from their home if indeed they still have a home to go to. They may need to travel for several days, often without money. YWB has had to establish a fund in order to provide emergency cash grants to detainees returning with nothing.   21. Even when it is known in advance by enforcement officers that a person will be detained, provision for the collection of belongings is not made. This prioritising of operational convenience over the safety and dignity of detainees, particularly women, seems disproportionate and arbitrary.  Recommendations Yaorder to fulfil its human rights obligations: 22. The DFT should be abolished in its entirety. Failing that, the DFT should be abolished for women as the UKBA has shown itself to be incapable of making sustainable  23. screening process should be completely overhauled to avoid inappropriate referral into the DFT. The UKBA should provide  detailed statistics of the reasons why applicants are eventually removed from the DFT. Those claiming asylum at port of arrival or voluntarily making appointments at the Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon should never be placed on the DFT. 24. The UKBA should vulnerable individuals really are exceptional, rather than the norm, as appears to exist today.  25. Greater care must be taken in identifying victims of torture and trafficking. If independent evidence is lacking, it should be actively obtained. 26. Mothers of minor children and expectant mothers should not be detained for more than three days, or seven days in exceptional circumstances, in line with the limit now applied to the detention of children.19 27. The UKBA should ensure that reasonable attempts are made to ensure people have their property before they are detained.                                                            19 UKBA Operating Standands for Pre-Departure Accomodation, http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/op-standards-pre-departure/op-standards-pre-dep/op-standards.pdf?view=Binary, accessed 11/11/11.
